March 6, 2017
Neil Marnoch
Registrar
University of Manitoba
Dear Mr. Marnoch,
I am writing to request a change in the winter 2017 academic schedule for the MOT course, OT 7800 Advanced
Fieldwork.
Current dates: July 4-September 15, 2017 (6 week block with a flexible start date; must end by September 15).
Amended dates: June 19-September 15, 2017 (6 week block with a flexible start date; must end by September 15).
Note: This course is a fieldwork/practicum that occurs within the occupational therapy community. The
course is the equivalent of 6 full time weeks and is flexible to allow for all of our students to be
accommodated in the occupational therapy community. As the fieldwork occurs over the summer months at
times recruitment of fieldwork sites can be difficult.
Reason/rationale for change:
Typically, OT 7800 is scheduled to start immediately after the completion of the winter academic term (MOT courses:
OT 7740, OT 7750, OT 7760, and OT 7770). This year the winter academic block for these courses is ending June 16,
2017 rather than the typical June 30th.
By allowing OT 7800 to start as early as June 19th there will be increased flexibility for fieldwork dates, thus
improving fieldwork site recruitment.
Respectfully submitted,

Pamela Wener
Associate Professor and Acting Head
Department of Occupational Therapy

of the course who has met the criteria outlined above. In the event of a tie, the course professor will
decide which of the highest mark recipients will receive the award based on their overall scholarship and
participation in the course.
The Dean of the Faculty of Law (or designate) will name the selection committee for this award.
This agreement may be amended by the mutual consent of the donor (or designate) and the University of
Manitoba. All such amendments shall be in writing. In the absence of the donor (or designate), and

The Joyce Family Foundation Youth in Care Tuition Grants
The Joyce Family Foundation has established an endowment fund valued at $1,000,000 to offer Youth in
Care Tuition Grants. The purpose of the grants is to provide the opportunity for youth who are, or who
have been, in the care of Child and Family Services to attend post-secondary education. The grants will
cover the costs of undergraduate tuition up to a maximum of $5,000 per year for a maximum of 4 years
for each recipient.
The available annual income accrued from The Joyce Family Foundation donation will first be used.
Once the available annual income has been depleted, an existing fund held in Financial Aid and Awards
will be used to supplement the award.
Each year, up to 10 renewable tuition grants will be offered to undergraduate students who:
(1) are, or will be, enrolled full-time (minimum 60% course load) in any undergraduate degree or
diploma program at the University of Manitoba in the year in which the award is tenable;
(2) have a record of satisfactory academic achievement which is defined as:

admission;
(b) for continuing students, a minimum degree grade point average of 2.0;
(3) are currently, or formerly, a youth in care in the ward of any province across Canada;

17

(1) remain enrolled full-time (minimum 60% course load) in any undergraduate degree or diploma
program at the University of Manitoba;
(2) continue to maintain a minimum degree grade point average of 2.0;
(3) continue to demonstrate financial need on the Youth-In-Care Tuition Grant Application.
Preference will be given to students who are not receiving government funding, including, but not limited
to, band funding or students loans. Preference will also be given to students who have graduated high
school within the past five to seven years.
The selection committee will be named by the Director of Financial Aid and Awards (or designate).
This agreement may be amended by the mutual consent of the donor (or designate) and the University of
Manitoba. All such amendments shall be in writing. In the absence of the donor (or designate), and
providing all reasonable efforts have been made to consult, the Board of Governors of the University of
Manitoba has the right to modify the terms of this award if, because of changed conditions, it becomes
necessary to do so. Such modification shall conform as closely as possible to the expressed intention of
the donor in establishing the award.

In Memoriam: Dr. James N. Wright

Dr. James N. Wright, Dean of the College of Dentistry from 1994-1997 has passed away. He passed on
February 14, 2017 after a prolonged battle with cancer and surrounded by his devoted family. He was 83
years old and leaves behind Eliane, his wife and partner of 57 years, his daughters Tamara, Michele and
Lisa.
Dr. Wright was born in Lethbridge, Alberta and left home at a young age in order to study, work and
earn his way in the world. No job was too big or too small if it helped him achieve his goals. Originally set
on studying Physics (which he took as an elective for “fun” at the University of Alberta) he switched
courses, completing his dental degree through the Canadian Armed Forces. Shortly afterwards, he met
and married Eliane.
Dr. Wright reached the pinnacle of not one but two separate careers. A consummate leader within the
Canadian Armed Forces Dental Corps for 33 years, he achieved the rank of Brigadier General. Upon
retirement from the military in 1986, he became Head of the Department of Stomatology, Associate
Dean and finally Dean of the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Manitoba until his second
retirement in 1997. Few would have been able to excel in such disparate environments but Dr. Wright
was admired for his intelligence and diligence as well as his decisive, fair and pragmatic leadership. With
awards and accomplishments too numerous to list, Dr. Wright was invested as Honorary Dental Surgeon
to the Queen and left an indelible mark on military dentistry.
His forward thinking leadership as Dean of Dentistry ensured success for the next generation of dental
professionals. Enthusiastic travellers, James and Eliane embraced retirement with customary vigor,
continuing to travel the globe and made Ajijic Mexico their winter home for over 20 years. A true hero
to his family and many friends in Canada, the US and Mexico; Dr. Wright’s legacy of lifelong learning,
dedication to family and commitment to national and professional duty will forever be admired.

PRESIDENT'S REPORT: April 5, 2017
GENERAL
Late in January, the University of Manitoba community came together at the Fort Garry and Bannatyne
campuses to discuss the impact of the U.S. executive order, banning travel to the United States from
seven Muslim-majority countries, and the shooting at a mosque in Quebec that resulted in the death of
six men and injuries to another 19. The events reinforced the values shared in the University of
Manitoba community to diversity, and to safe spaces for the free exchange of ideas and knowledge.
Those affected have been directed to supports ranging from counselling to financial assistance, available
through a range of University offices.
The Government of Canada and Province of Manitoba announced $36 million in funding on January 24
to support the development of the University of Manitoba Smartpark Innovation Hub, as well as the new
Stanley Pauley Engineering Building. $32 million will come from the federal government’s PostSecondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) and $4 million from the Government of
Manitoba. The Smartpark Innovation Hub will be an information exchange centre that will encourage
further partnerships between industry, government and the University and will include new space for
the laboratories, provide rentable space for companies, and be home for SmartPark’s North Forge
incubator. The construction of the Stanley Pauley Engineering Building will promote greater industry
collaboration.
On February 28, the University of Manitoba hosted the UM 140 Celebration for students, faculty and
staff, alumni and community members. Over 3,000 attendees participated in the day-long event, which
included a Sunrise Ceremony at the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, Pancake Breakfasts at
the Brodie Atrium and UMSU University Centre, a Winter Festival at Chancellor’s Circle, and a Retirees’
Coffee & Conversation event at Marshall McLuhan Hall. The formal ceremony at the Winter Festival
Kick-off included remarks from President Barnard, Premier Brian Pallister, Minister Jim Carr, Senator
Patricia Bovey, Mayor Brian Bowman, Board of Governors Chair Rennie Zegalski, Alumni Association
President Kim Metcalfe, UMSU President Tanjit Nagra and GSA President Enoch A-Iyeh. Attendees at the
event included Minister Ian Wishart, Terry Duguid, MP, Winnipeg South, and President Emeritus Emőke
Szathmáry. More information may be found here: https://uofm140.cc.umanitoba.ca/
On March 6, AESES and the Office of the President hosted the 15th annual International Women’s Day
Dinner, this year featuring a keynote address by Dr. Deborah Stienstra, professor in the department of
disability studies, entitled “Implicating Inclusion: Women with Disabilities as Visionaries, Innovators,
and Pioneers”. The event offered members of the University of Manitoba community a unique
opportunity to consider matters of inclusion, accessibility, equity and disability rights.
The 2017 Distinguished Alumni Award recipients have now been publicly announced and they are an
impressive group of individuals who have demonstrated outstanding achievement both professionally
and personally. The 2017 recipients are John and Patricia Patkau (Lifetime Achievement), Reva Stone
(Professional Achievement), Sister Lesley Sacouman (Community Service), Isabella Wiebe (Service to the
University of Manitoba) and Desiree Scott (Outstanding Young Alumni). The Celebration of Excellence
will be held on May 2, 2017 at the Metropolitan Event Centre.

•

The College of Pharmacy welcomed hundreds of pharmacy students from across Canada to
Professional Development Week, a national student-led conference. This year’s theme, “Beyond
Boundaries,” reflected the ever-changing nature of the pharmacy profession.

•

The College of Nursing hosted more than 400 nursing students from across Canada at the Canadian
Nursing Students’ Association 2017 national conference. The theme of the student-run conference
at the Radisson Hotel was “Breaking Barriers Through the Exploration of Cultural Safety.”

•

The sixth annual Rich Man Poor Man dinner organized by medical students raised funds and hygiene
donations for Agape Table and created awareness about food security, poverty and the need for
affordable nutrition.

•

The College of Rehabilitation Sciences launched Illuminate: Global Reflections on Rehabilitation

•

In February, a single mother and her two sons received the keys to a new home built for them
through a partnership between the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences and Habitat for Humanity
Manitoba. The inner-city bungalow is custom-designed for accessibility to meet the family’s special
needs. It is the third Habitat home that volunteers from the Faculty have helped to erect. More than
100 people volunteered during the nine-day build of the home’s exterior last June.

RESEARCH MATTERS

28

•

On January 16, Research Manitoba and Genome Canada announced $4 million in funding for
GENICE: a large-scale applied research project (LSARP). LSARP is one of Genome Canada’s funding
programs and is aimed at projects using genomic approaches to address challenges and
opportunities of importance to Canada’s natural resources, including interactions between natural
resources and the environment, thereby contributing to Canada’s bioeconomy and the well-being of
Canadians. GENICE is a partnered project between the University of Manitoba researcher Gary Stern
(Environment and Geography) and the University of Calgary professor Casey Hubert. The duo will
combine their expertise in the areas of genomics, petroleomics and sea-ice physics to investigate
the potential for native microbial communities to mitigate oil spills, as warmer temperatures and
melting sea ice usher in increasing shipping throughout Arctic waters. This research will be
undertaken at the Churchill Marine Observatory, a unique research facility the University of
Manitoba is building in Churchill, MB with support from many partners, and on board the Canadian
Coast Guard Ship Amundsen.

•

The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) announced $369,642 in
funding on February 15 through a Strategic Partnerships Grant to Ying Chen (Biosystems
Engineering). Her project will investigate conservation agriculture, specifically, new ways to till and
seed soil. Chen will team up with two large Canadian manufacturers (Buhler Versatile Inc. and AtomJet Group) to develop VT and VS machines that will increase field efficiency by a factor of two with
crop residue reaching levels of 100 per cent. This project will involve seven graduate students being
trained by 11 team members, including faculty members and industrial researchers, engineers, and
technical staff.

•

On January 19, the University of Manitoba, University of Winnipeg and Red River College were all
represented in the four finalist teams who competed in the Game Changer finale. The competition,
targeting university students and post-doctoral fellows from all disciplines and at all post-secondary
institutions in Manitoba, handed out the grand prize of $10,000 to Team Loop for their solution to
the problem of e-waste. Their idea: a weekend-long event where people could have any type of
electronic waste picked up at their curb free of charge. The three member team included: Haneen
Shouman and Michael Hall, students in the Asper School of Business MBA program, and Maria
Sanchez who is studying marketing management through extended education at the University of
Winnipeg.
Second place ($4,000) and People’s Choice ($750) winners were Team Opes, with their presentation
on how to improve financial literacy. Team Easy A(ctivity) was third place earning $2,000 for an idea
that would help university students improve their physical activity. Game Changer is an initiative of
the Office of the Vice-President (Research and International) and was co-organized by the Stu Clark
Centre for Entrepreneurship and the Technology Transfer Office. For more details on the
competition, visit umanitoba.ca/gamechanger

Dear Dr. Hultin,
The College of Nursing supports the establishment of the College of Nursing Bursary (Indigenous), College
of Nursing (Indigenous Year 2), College of Nursing (Indigenous Year 3), and College of Nursing
(Indigenous Year 4).
In the Fall Term of 2016, the University of Manitoba’s Indigenous undergraduate student population was 7.8%
of total enrolment, compared to Manitoba’s Indigenous population of 16.7% 1
Indigenous student enrolment data for the past five years in the College of Nursing is provided for context in
the table below.

As an institution, our commitment is to increase the number of Indigenous students on our campuses.
Increasing the number of bursaries, scholarships and awards for Indigenous students contributes to this
commitment. This scholarship will provide the College of Nursing the opportunity to recruit, support and
retain Indigenous students at the University of Manitoba and, in doing so, will also contribute to the success of
individual Indigenous students.
Sincerely,

Dr. Beverly O’Connell

The SCCCC considered curriculum and course changes proposed by the Department of
Statistics, Faculty of Science, at its meetings on October 12, October 18, and October
28, 2016.

3.

The Senate Planning and Priorities Committee (SPPC) also considered the proposal
from the Department of Statistics, Faculty of Science, at its meeting on November 28,
2016.

Observations
1.

The Department of Statistics is proposing the introduction of two courses and the
modification of eight courses, as set out in the attachment to the Report. The overall
number of credit hours offered by the department would increase by 6 credit hours.
The department is also proposing modifications to the following programs, including
changes to the program notes:

The introduction of STAT 1150 – Introduction to Statistics and Computing (3) and STAT
2150 – Statistics and Computing, anticipates future changes to curricula for Statistics
programs in the Department that would reflect a new model for teaching and research in
the discipline, to be brought forward to Senate in a subsequent year(s). In the current
model, the first years of the curricula provide mathematical and theoretical foundations,
including in algebra, probability theory, and statistical inference theory, for example.
Computational tools and applications are introduced in the upper years of the program.

46

The new model for teaching statistics, which is driven by big data science, aims to
engage and retain students in statistics programs, by exposing students to
computational methods and the application of statistics, using real data from academic
research and government, from the start of the program.
The proposed courses, which are designed for students in mathematically rich
disciplines, including Statistics, Mathematics, Actuarial Mathematics, and Computer
Science, for example, respond to this trend in the discipline. STAT 1150 - Introduction to
Statistics and Computing, would teach students fundamental concepts in statistics (e.g.
data, random sampling, background of the data) and STAT 2150 - Statistics and
Computing would introduce students to fundamental statistical tools, including statistical
software.
3.

The two new courses, STAT 1150 and STAT 2150 would include a laboratory. The
Department is also proposing to modify two existing courses to include a laboratory,
STAT 1000 – Basic Statistical Analysis 1 and STAT 2000 – Basic Statistical Analysis 2.
The objectives for adding a laboratory section to the last two courses are to increase
student interest in the material and the effectiveness of learning, by facilitating
interactions and discussions among students in small groups, and to address high DFW
rates in these courses.

4.

The SCCCC has endorsed course and curriculum changes proposed by the
Department, and strongly supports the pedagogical objectives of the proposed changes,
as reflected in the course introductions and modifications to STAT 1000 and STAT 2000,
in particular.

5.

Revenue generated from laboratory fees and Department resources would be used to
pay for the labs for STAT 1000, STAT 1150, STAT 2000, and STAT 2150. The Faculty
of Science has agreed to cover any shortfall, as confirmed in the letter from Dean Baum
(dated October 26, 2016) included with this Report.

6.

The Department has indicated that each laboratory section would cost approximately
$1,410.00, to cover the cost of a salary for a Teaching Assistant, assuming a salary of
$23.50/hour and six hours of work / week for ten weeks. Laboratory fees ($30.00 /
student) for fifty students / laboratory section would total $1,500.00 would cover this
amount.

7.

The Registrar’s Office has confirmed that there would be sufficient space to offer the
laboratory sections, which would require fifty-two rooms in the Fall Term and forty-four
rooms in the Winter Term, as outlined in the communication from Mr. Marnoch (dated
October 26, 2016) attached to the Report.

Recommendation
The Senate Committee on Curriculum and Course Changes recommends:
THAT Senate approve curriculum and course changes proposed by the Department of
Statistics, Faculty of Science, effective September 1, 2017.
Comments of the Senate Executive Committee:
The Senate Executive Committee endorses the
report to Senate.

Report of the Senate Planning and Priorities Committee RE: Undergraduate Curriculum
and Course Changes, Department of Statistics, Faculty of Science
Preamble:
1.

The terms of reference for the Senate Planning and Priorities Committee (SPPC) specify
that the committee may make recommendations to Senate regarding … any such
studies, proposals or reports that it may initiate within itself, have referred to it by Senate
other Councils, Committees or Bodies, formal or otherwise. See section 1 (c). The terms
of reference are available at:
(http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/governance/sen_committ
ees/510.html)

2.

At its meetings on November 28, 2016 and January 30, 2017, the Committee considered
curriculum and course changes proposed by the Department of Statistics, Faculty of
Science. The proposal had been referred to the Committee by the Senate Committee on
Curriculum and Course Changes (SCCCC), to consider the resource implications of the
proposal.

3.

The SCCCC also considered the proposal at several meetings in October 2016.

Observations:
1.

The Department of Statistics is proposing the introduction of two courses and the
modification of eight courses. The overall number of credit hours offered by the
Department would increase by 6 credit hours. The Department is also proposing
modifications to various programs, as set out in the proposal and summarized in the
Report of the SCCCC. Many of the program modifications follow from proposed course
changes.

2.

The SPPC considered the resource implications of proposals to introduce two courses
with a laboratory, STAT 1150 – Introduction to Statistics and Computing and STAT 2150
– Statistics and Computing, and to modify two existing courses to include a laboratory,
STAT 1000 – Basic Statistical Analysis 1 and STAT 2000 – Basic Statistical Analysis 2.

3.

The objective for introducing STAT 1150 and STAT 2150, which are designed for
students in mathematically rich disciplines, is to expose students to computational
methods and the application of statistics using real data, in order to engage and retain
students in statistics programs, in particular. Objectives for introducing a laboratory for
STAT 1000 and STAT 2000 are to increase student interest in the material and raise the
effectiveness of student learning by facilitating small-group learning, and to address high
DFW rates in these courses as they are currently offered.

4.

The Faculty of Science has indicated that no new teaching resources (faculty positions)
would be required to deliver STAT 1150 and STAT 2150. The Faculty assumes that
enrolment across, and the total number of sections offered for, the four courses (STAT
1000, STAT 1150, STAT 2000, STAT 2150) would be the same as current enrolment
(4,800 students) and number of sections offered in STAT 1000 and STAT 2000. The
Department would offer three sections of STAT 1150 and one section of STAT 2150 in

48

the 2017-2018 Academic Session. The number of sections of STAT 1000 and STAT
2000 would, correspondingly, be reduced and Instructors currently teaching these
sections would be reassigned to teach sections in STAT 1150 and STAT 2150.
In future, if increased demand for STAT 1150 and STAT 2150 necessitated that
additional sections be created in these courses, the number of sections of STAT 1000
and STAT 2000 would be decreased proportionally.
5.

The introduction of the laboratories would be cost neutral. Revenue from laboratory fees
($30.00 per student * 50 students per section = $1,500 per section) would be used to
cover the salary costs of Teaching Assistants ($1,410.00 per section). The balance of
the revenue from laboratory fees ($90.00 per section) would be used to cover any
unexpected deficiencies. The Faculty of Science would cover any shortfall, as indicated
by Dean Baum in her letter dated October 26, 2016.

6.

In the short-term, there would be no new costs associated with delivering laboratories for
online sections of STAT 1000 and STAT 2000, as Instructors would use their regular
office hours to moderate pre-designed laboratory activities. The Faculty, together with
the Centre for the Advancement of Teaching and Learning (CATL) and Information
Services and Technology (IST), will consider purchasing software to offer online
laboratories as live-discussion forums in the future.

7.

The Faculty anticipates that the proposed course changes could potentially reduce the
resources required to deliver Statistics courses, including STAT 1000 and STAT 2000, in
particular, by improving student success rates in these courses and thereby reducing
DFW rates and course repeats.

8.

The Registrar’s Office has confirmed that there would be sufficient classroom space to
deliver the ninety-six (96) laboratory sections that would be required, for the four courses
in question, over the Fall and Winter Terms. The analysis by the Registrar’s Office
included several constraints, as outlined in an email from Mr. Marnoch (dated October
26, 2016), including that section capacities would not exceed fifty (50) students and that
the laboratory sections would normally be scheduled in early morning and later
afternoon, when there is less demand for classroom spaces.

9.

It was noted that the proposal to establish laboratory sections for the statistics courses
was being made at a time when the Faculty of Science has reduced, and has forecast
the potential need to further reduce, the number of 1000- and 2000- level course
offerings, citing insufficient teaching resources, particularly for salaries for Teaching
Assistants, given recent budgetary challenges. A concern was raised that additional
teaching costs entailed by the introduction of the statistics laboratories might lead to a
reduction of course sections in STAT 1000, in particular, which would impact students in
programs across the University who complete this course in order to meet either a
program requirement or the University’s Mathematics (M) requirement. The concern also
related to the potential need to reduce the number of sections for 1000-level courses
with laboratory teaching in other departments in the Faculty of Science.
Responding to these concerns, Dean Baum said that the Faculty cannot determine at
present, whether or not it would be necessary to reduce the number of 1000- and 2000level course sections, as the Faculty’s budget for future years is not known. She
indicated that the Faculty is committed to teaching as many students as possible.

10.

SPPC endorses the course and curriculum changes proposed by the Department of
Statistics, on the basis of its strong support for the pedagogical objectives of the
proposed changes, notwithstanding uncertainty on budget resources, laboratory fee

49

revenues, and resource allocations within the Faculty of Science to support 1000- and
2000-level science courses with laboratories.

Recommendation:
The Senate Planning and Priorities Committee recommends:
THAT Senate approve the Report of the Senate Planning and Priorities Committee
concerning curriculum and course changes proposed by the Department of
Statistics, Faculty of Science, effective September 1, 2017.

Respectfully submitted,
Ms. Ada Ducas, Chair
Senate Planning and Priorities Committee

50

The Statistics department is proposing to add a tutorial component to the existing courses, STAT 1000
and STAT 2000. The proposed tutorial component will facilitate interactions and group discussions
among students in relatively small groups and therefore increase the effectiveness of learning and
interests of students in the material. Each lab will consist of no more than 50 students in order to
facilitate interaction and discussion. Problem solving and quizzes will be the main activities.
The Statistics department is also proposing to offer two new introductory level Statistics courses, STAT
1150 and STAT 2150. These courses have been designed as introductory courses that are recommended
for students in mathematically rich disciplines, including Statistics, Mathematics, Actuarial Science,
Computer Science and related interdisciplinary programs. These courses will also include a tutorial
component.
The SCCCC has asked the Faculty of Science to provide information related to the resources required to
implement this proposed modification to STAT 1000 and STAT 2000, and the proposed introduction of
STAT 1150 and 2150. Specifically, the financial resources required, the space resources required, and the
resources required to offer a similar laboratory experience for those students registered in the
distance/online versions of the courses.
Students will not be able to hold credit for STAT 1000 or STAT 2000 with the newly proposed STAT 1150.
At least initially, the expectation is that the same number of students will be registered in the four
courses, STAT 1000, 2000, 1150 & 2150, as there are currently registered in STAT 1000 and STAT 2000.
These four courses will have about 2600 students in the Fall and about 2200 students in the Winter
term. We expect to have a maximum of 50 students per tutorial. This plan will require 52 rooms in the
fall and 44 rooms in the winter (for a total of 96 labs over the full academic year).
Note that some number of labs in the above calculations would be attributed to STAT 1150/2150. We
expect the number of labs required for STAT 1150/2150 to be of the order of 7-10 in the first year.
Each class will have 10 sessions per term, as tutorials will begin from 2nd week of the term. We expect
about 6 hours of TA work per week (1 hour lab + 1.5 hours prep + 3.5 hours marking).
Lab fees per lab section = 30 $/student × 50 students/section = $1,500.00
Approximate TA salary = 23.5 $/hr × 6 hrs/week × 10 weeks = $1,410.00
Remaining $90/lab would be used to cover any unexpected deficiencies due to students VW etc. Any
further deficiencies will be covered by the Faculty. Attached is a letter of support from the Dean of the
Faculty of Science indicating this support exists.
The Statistics department has consulted with the Registrar’s Office regarding the availability of
classrooms for the lab components that are proposed. The Registrar’s Office has confirmed that the
space required for these proposed labs can be accommodated. Attached is the response from the
Registrar, Neil Marnoch.
Regarding the development of a lab for the online/distance version of STAT 1000 and STAT 2000, in the
short-term we plan to have pre designed lab activities for STAT 1000/2000 and instructors of the online
versions of STAT 1000/2000 will use the same activities as weekly practice supplements. Instructors will
use their regular office hours for moderating these activities and solutions will be posted at the end of
the week. As a result there will be no extra cost for conducting online labs in the immediate term.

51

In the long-term we expect to develop and utilize an online laboratory component where the instructor
can have live weekly discussion forums such that all students can participate in a virtual classroom
environment. This will be possible when the technological tools and a virtual one-to-many classroom
environment are made available. The Faculty, CATL, and IST are currently investigating two vendors for
their software to videotape lectures (or laboratory sessions). The technology has both live streaming
and on-demand capabilities. Our instructors have participated in some of these information sessions
and IST is discussing the option of integrating this new software with UM Learn. Our online labs are not
contingent on such technology being available.

Senate Committee on Curriculum and Course Changes:
The Dean's Office fully supports the new course modifications proposed by the Department
of Statistics. Through these changes, we will be offering students learning options that are more
relevant to today's problems and their solutions, as found In Statistics.
A concern raised by the committee Is the cost of delivering the new labs/tutorials. The Dean of
Science has worked with the Department of Statistics to ensure that the labs will Incur no
additional costs, but If such costs do arise, the budget of the Faculty of Science will cover them.
Sincerely,

Message from Neil Ma rnoch, Regist rar

Hello Sa man, this will confirm that the Registrar's Office has determined there is sufficient
classroom space to accommodate the addition of once per week, 50 minute tutorials for STAT 1000
and STAT 2000 commencing Fall 2017 within the following constraints:
•

Section capacities will not exceed 50 students

•

Rooms may be furnished with tables or with tablet seating

•

Tutorials will be offered during the following times:
o Monday, Wednesday and Fridays: 8:30, 2;30, 3:30 and 4:30
o Tuesday and Thursdays: a morning start time no later than 9:00; afternoon times of
2:30, 3:30 and 4:30, or 2:30 and 4:00 timeslots nested in the 75 minute time
periods. (Because we would utilize the same rooms for all sections and because not
many students take other courses at these times, we would have fewer concerns
about off-grid scheduling on those afternoons.)
o If space is available after lectures have been assigned to classes, some sections may
be re-scheduled to be offered between 9:30 and 2:30 MWF or between 11:30 and
2:30 on T Th as space permits.
o As much as is possible, an equal number of sections must be offered in each
corresponding timeslot in order to optimize room usage. e.g. 4 sections at 8:30 on
each of Monday, Wednesday and Friday, as opposed to 4 sections on Monday, 6 on
Wednesday and 2 on Friday.

This analysis was conducted based on our current room inventory, existing class schedules and an
absence of regulations that require classes to be evenly distributed thought the day. If such
regulations are introduced, there may be more space available in the mid-day time periods that
would allow more scheduling options for the Stats tutorials. Please let me know if you have any
questions or concerns.

PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE B.Sc. HONOURS

& MAJOR PROGRAMS IN STATISTICS

4. 13.l Program Information

Statistics is a discipline grounded in mathematics that has practical applications in many other areas.
Statistics is an analytical discipline that helps other disciplines carry out research projects and studies that
involve measurement, comparison, and interpretation. Statistics is a useful ancillary subject to other
sciences, the social sciences, and many of the professional programs. The department offers joint
programs with Mathematics, Computer Science, Economics and Actuarial Mathematics.
Honours Requirements

St1:1aeRts will Rermally take STAT 2000 aRa STAT 2400 iR Year 2 ana eRter Hene1:1rs iR Year 3.
To enter the Honours program in Statistics, a student must have completed at least 24 credit hours with a
minimum DGPA of 3.00, and also obtained a minimum grade of"B" in STAT~ 2150.

STAT-l-000 1150, MATH 1220, MATH 1230, MATH 1232 and MATH 1240 are all requirements of the
Statistics Honours degree program and students are strongly encouraged to take these courses in Year I.
To continue in the Statistics Honours program, students must maintain a minimum DGPA of3.00, and
complete a minimum of 9 credit hours during each Fall and Winter Term.
To graduate with the B. Sc. Honours degree, a student must achieve a minimum DGPA of3.00 and
minimum grade of"C" in each course that contributes to the 120 credit hours of the degree.
Statistics Honours Cooperative O ption

Students interested in alternating academic terms and terms of paid employment as part of their Honours
Statistics program may enter the Cooperative Option in April of their second year in Honours Statistics.
This program provides students with a minimum of 12 months of paid employment by the time they
graduate. It enables them to obtain work experience in research and industry with participating firms,
government agencies and university units.
The course and grade requirements for entry to this option are the same as those required for entry to the
regular Honours program (see above), as indicated in the chart. Students are required to complete the first
and second year requirements of the program; and STAT 3470 and ST AT 3480 before they begin their
first employment term. Students should refer to the general faculty regulations for B.Sc. (Honours)
Cooperative Option in Section 3.6.
To continue in the Honours Cooperative program a student must maintain a minimum DGPA of3.00,
successfully complete each work term and complete a minimum of9 credit hours during each academic
term. Students should note that the grade requirements for the Cooperative Option are the same as that for
the regular Honours program (see above).

Students must check with the Co-op office for the April application deadline information. They will
normally be notified of their provisional acceptance in the program by September. Acceptance into the

58

program is dependent upon the student receiving an employment placement. Employment term positions
available to the students will be approved by the department, and the employers will select the students
they wish to employ. St udents are advised that satisfying the entrance requirements does not guarantee a
place in the Cooperative Option if the demand for places exceeds the number of places available. The
department reserves the right to select the best qualified applicants.
Students are required to register in and pay fees for each employment term prior to the commencement of
each employment term. Students will be required to submit an employment report upon the completion of
each employment term.

The course and grade requirements for entry to this option are the same as those required for entry to the
regular Major program. Students are required to complete the first and second year requirements of the
program; and STAT 3470 and ST AT 3480 before they begin their first employment term. Students should
refer to the general faculty regulations for B.Sc. (Major) Cooperative Option in Section 3.4.

To continue in the four year Major program a student must maintain a minimum DGPA of2.00. Students
should note that the grade requirements for the Cooperative Option are the same as that for the regular
Major program (see above).
Students must check with the Co-op office for the April application deadline information. They will
normally be notified of their provisional acceptance in the program by September. Acceptance into the
program is dependent upon the student receiving an employment placement. Employment term positions
avai lable to the students will be approved by the department, and the employers will select the students
they wish to employ. Students are advised that satisfying the entrance requirements does not guarantee a
place in the Cooperative Option if the demand for places exceeds the number of places available. The
department reserves the right to select the best qualified applicants.
Students are required to register in and pay fees for each employment term prior to the commencement of

59

each employment term. Students will be required to submit an employment report upon the completion of
each employment term.
Major Program Specific Courses
All courses specified in the program charts below (excluding the required optional courses and electives).
The department must approve a student's four year Major program each session. Students must obtain
departmental approval for any and all revisions to their programs.
In order to improve their academic backgrounds as well as job opportunities, students should carefully
elect the optional courses in this program. They should particularly consider one of the following
sequences of courses in Economics &R4 or Computer Science.
Economics: ECON 1010, ECON 1020, ECON 2010, ECON 2020, ECON 2030, ECON 3010, ECON
3020, ECON 3030, ECON 3040, ECON 4040, ECON 4042. (This list of courses is effective as offal!

June 24, 2016
Report of the Faculty Council of Graduate Studies on Program and Curriculum Changes
 
Preamble:

1.

The Faculty of Graduate Studies has responsibility for all matters relating to the
submission of graduate course, curriculum and program changes. Recommendations for
new programs or changes are submitted by the Faculty Council of Graduate Studies for
the approval of Senate.

2.

The Faculty Council of Graduate Studies met on June 24, 2016 to consider a proposal
for a new Master of Human Rights program.

Observations:
A new Master of Human Rights program is being proposed. The proposal includes four (4)
course introductions. Please see attached for complete details.
Canada’s only Master of Human Rights degree program will equip graduates to help address
the increasingly complex human rights challenges of the 21st century. It will be broadly
interdisciplinary and take advantage of expertise in the University of Manitoba’s professional
schools, including Law, Education and Social Work. The MHR program will prepare students to
integrate human rights perspectives into their careers in the private and/or public sectors by
developing research, advocacy and negotiation skills, as well as professional competencies.
The program will emphasize critical engagement with the conception, practice and
institutionalization of human rights while preparing students to make ethical, competent,
innovative and effective contributions to human rights work locally, nationally and globally.
The MHR pulls together existing human rights courses from numerous University of Manitoba
faculties to form a coherent program, with the addition of new core courses, a practicum, a
major research project and a thesis option.


Credential to be granted: Master of Human Rights



Length of program: Practicum stream-16 months; Thesis stream-24 months



Proposed program start date: 09 / 2019



Funding request: $57,730 per year.



Anticipated external funding for program implementation/delivery: Total $8.6 million.
The MHR program is seeking support from major donors through the U of M philanthropy
department, which has made this program a priority in the university’s ongoing capital
campaign:
o $620,000 renovations to create a dedicated space for MHR students and faculty
members in St. Paul’s college
o $5-million endowed chair to recruit and support a top human rights
researcher/teacher (the assistant professor described below).
o $3-million endowment fund for MHR student fellowships and bursaries ($1.5 million
from donors to be matched by the Manitoba Scholarship and Bursaries initiative)
1 

 

71

June 24, 2016
Report of the Faculty Council of Graduate Studies on Program and Curriculum Changes
 
o

Raised to date: $1 million for bursary fund (2 X $250,000 from donors + matching
$500,000 from government). Left to raise: $7.6 million: $6.6 million from donors ($5
million chair, $1 million more fellowships/bursaries, $620,000 renovations), another
$1 million government matching funds for fellowships/bursaries



Resource implications (institution):
o Budget: approximately $93,000 in startup funds will be requested from a special U
of M operating budget allocation for strategic priorities (“inspiring minds” and
“forging connections”), as part of 2018-19 budget submissions due in fall 2017.
o Space: Renovations are required to the south wing of the St. Paul’s College second
floor (see Appendix E) to convert classrooms into study carrel and lounge space, to
be shared with PACS grad students.
o Computer:
 Students will have access to the St. Paul’s College computer lab.
 New desktop computers and phones will be required for the co-ordinator,
office assistant, new assistant professor and MHR program director.
 A new printer/fax/scanner will be required for the program.
 A separate printer will be required in the staff office for confidential
materials.
o IT: The new program should have no significant effect on information services and
technology facilities.
o Libraries: The U of M library system can support this new program with a
combination of existing resources and minimal ($400) expenditure from existing
acquisition funds. (See attached resource implication statement.)
o Student services: The Registrar foresees no problems supporting this program with
respect to registration, fee assessment and academic evaluation.



Resource implications (staffing):
o Reallocation of existing faculty: An existing University of Manitoba faculty
member will be appointed as founding MHR graduate program director. Dr. Adam
Muller has expressed interest in this role. The MHR graduate program director, the
chair of a new Coordinating Committee for Graduate Social Justice Programs and
professors teaching core MHR courses will receive teaching release from the MHR
budget, with the related funds redirected to their home departments. The theory and
methods courses will be taught by a rotating roster of interested professors from the
partner faculties, including the MHR graduate program director and a new assistant
professor. Dr. Annette Desmarais (Canada Research Chair in Human Rights, Social
Justice and Food Sovereignty) and Dr. Adam Muller have already expressed
interest in teaching theory and leading professional seminars. Canadian Museum
for Human Rights curator Armando Perla is currently teaching LAW 3018, which will
become the third core course. Faculty members in a number of disciplines are
eager to take on additional graduate students beyond those they are able to recruit
through their departments. More than 50 faculty members have agreed to serve as
advisors for student research. In most cases, they will do so without receiving
additional teaching release.
o Hiring of new faculty: A new tenure-track assistant professor will be hired as a
named chair and appointed to whichever academic department is most closely
aligned with her/his area of expertise. A letter of agreement will outline the chair’s

relationship with the department, including that its tenure and promotion procedures
will apply. Candidates for the new position will require expertise in human rights
research methods and international, regional and domestic human rights systems.
This chair will teach a core credit course (initially methods), oversee the practicum
and explore development of further courses, including online options.
Administrative services: A new full-time co-ordinator (Admin. Assistant 2 in the
AESES contract) will be hired to support the MHR program, including liaison with
practicum hosts, trouble-shooting fieldwork logistics, and organizing professional
seminars and the annual research day. This position might be best suited to a
dynamic individual with a background in human rights work. A half-time office
assistant (Office Assistant 3) will assist with tasks such as expense reporting,
payroll, student awards and travel booking. These staff members will also support
the Social Justice chair and will work closely with existing office assistants in PACS
and Disability Studies.
Resource implications (capital infrastructure and equipment): We anticipate
that the main renovations required to accommodate MHR faculty members and
students in St. Paul’s College will be covered by donors. However, this new
graduate program also makes the need for an elevator in St. Paul’s College more
urgent, as this upper-floor space and many other areas of the college are not
currently physically accessible. The college rector has recently reminded the U of M
associate vice-president in charge of facilities about this issue.



Proposed tuition fees: $5,272 (Canadian students) and $10,720 (international students)
Students taking a language course that involves a lab will pay an extra $30 fee per term.



Governance: The MHR program will be a partnership between five faculties (Arts, Law,
Education, Social Work, Graduate Studies) and three centres (Centre for Human Rights
Research, Mauro Centre for Peace and Justice and National Centre for Truth and
Reconciliation) at the University of Manitoba, with support from other faculties.



Location: The new program will be physically located in St. Paul’s College in order to take
advantage of synergies with the Peace and Conflict Studies (PACS) programs. Note that
St. Paul’s College plans to build a new student residence that will include single rooms for
graduate students.



Admission criteria: In addition to the Faculty of Graduate Studies minimum requirements,
additional requirements for the MHR are as follows:
o A four-year bachelor’s degree with at least a B average (3.0 GPA) in the last 60
credit hours of study, to be completed before admission. Note that students with a
higher GPA may have a greater chance of acceptance in the competitive process.
o English Language Proficiency :
 TOEFL - Achieve a minimum iBT (internet based test) score of 100; or a
minimum score of 250 computer based test
 CanTEST - Achieve a minimum band of 5.0 in all four (4) skill areas
 IELTS - Achieve a minimum score of 7.0 on the Academic Module
 CAEL - Achieve a minimum 80 overall and 80 on each subtest
o At least one undergraduate-level course in human rights or equivalent field
experience is preferred.
o Two letters of reference.

January 30, 2017
Report of the Senate Planning and Priorities Committee on a Proposal to Establish a Master of
Human Rights
Preamble:
1. The terms of reference of the Senate Planning and Priorities Committee (SPPC) are found on
the website at
hhttp://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/governance/sen_committees/50
8.html wherein SPPC is charged with making recommendations to Senate regarding proposed
academic programs and is further charged with making recommendations to the President and
reporting to Senate on matters requiring prioritization including the prioritization of new or
modified programs with significant resource requirements.
2. The SPPC considered a proposal to establish a Master of Human Rights program, at its
meetings on September 26, 2016 and January 30, 2017.
3. The Faculty Council of Graduate Studies has endorsed, and recommends that Senate approve
a proposal to establish a Master of Human Rights.
4. The proponents of the program proposal did revise the proposal at the request of the SPPC. Of
note, the proponents identified space to house the program in the Tier Building rather than St.
Paul’s College, as reflected in the original proposal and, therefore, in the Report of the Faculty
Council of Graduate Studies. This revision also required changes to the budget related to
resources that would be required for renovations.

Observations:
1.

The proposed Master of Human Rights (M.H.R.) would be an interdisciplinary program that
would draw on expertise from across the University (including in the Faculties of Arts,
Education, Graduate Studies, Law, and Social Work, the Centre for Human Rights Research,
the Mauro Centre for Peace and Justice, and the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation)
to deliver a program that would prepare graduates, “… to integrate human rights perspectives
into careers in the private and/or public sectors by developing research, advocacy, and
negotiation skills, as well as professional competencies.”

2.

The proposed program would address a need for individuals, including citizens, government and
non-government workers, and business leaders, who understand Indigenous, newcomer,
disability, linguistic, religious, and gender rights and cultures, given changing demographics in
Canada. The program would prepare graduates to work in diverse careers, including with (i) civil
society organizations; (ii) governmental and international or regional departments and
organizations concerned with human rights, justice, immigration and refugees, social services,
health, etc.; (iii) Canadian human rights commissions, labour boards, and ombudspersons;
(iv) educational institutions that will design and implement education concerning human rights;
and (v) corporations and arts organizations that take human rights into account in their
operations.
The proposed program would be the only Master of Human Rights program in Canada. It is
anticipated that there would be demand for the program from: (i) recent graduates of related
undergraduate programs offered at the University of Manitoba and other universities in the

3.

77

province, including in the areas of disability studies, human rights, international development,
and peace and conflict studies; (ii) individuals who are working in, or seeking to work in, human
rights-related areas and/or decolonization efforts either nationally or internationally; and (iii)
individuals wanting to enhance previous education or training in other diverse areas, including
public administration, health, law enforcement, disability issues, journalism, the military, and
education.
4.

Enrolment would be limited to a maximum of fifteen (15) students each year. The committee
was convinced that there would be sufficient demand to fill these spaces each year based on
information that the number of applicants to the Master of Arts in Peace and Conflict Studies
exceeds the number of spaces each year. The University has also received inquiries about the
program from potential applicants, from across the country and abroad, who were aware of
plans for the program from media reports.

5.

In addition to the minimum requirements of the Faculty of Graduate Studies, admission
requirements would include a four-year Bachelor’s degree, with a minimum Grade Point
Average of 3.0 on the last 60 credit hours of study, English language proficiency at the same
level required for admission to the Master of Laws program, and, preferably, at least one
undergraduate course in human rights or equivalent field experience.

6.

Students would be required to complete 18 credit hours of course work and either (i) a
practicum and a major research project or (ii) a thesis. Course work requirements would include
three core courses (HMRT 7100 – Theory and Practice in Human Rights, HMRT 7200 –
Selected Topics in Human Rights, HMRT 7300 – Human Rights Law) and a minimum of three
additional courses from a list of approved electives, including graduate (7000- level) and postbaccalaureate (5000-level) courses, and undergraduate Law courses. Students whose first
language is English would also be required to demonstrate working knowledge of a second
language in order to graduate, as described in section B-1 of the proposal.

7.

The practicum/major research project stream would be a 16-month program and the thesis
stream would be a 16- to 24-month program.

8.

Establishment of the program would require the introduction of four courses totalling 12 credit
hours, as described in the proposal. Otherwise, the proposed program would make use of
existing courses from programs across the University, as outlined in Appendix A of the proposal.

9.

The total cost of delivering the program would be $117,566, in Year 4. Resources would be
derived from the following sources:

10.

•

a request to the province for $126,617 in Year 1 and ongoing program funding of $117,566
thereafter;

•

100 percent of tuition fees, which would generate $79,932 annually, assuming an annual
intake of 15 students;

•

annual income ($212,180) from a $5 million endowment fund for a research chair, to be
established with a gift from a private donor(s);

•

annual income ($127,308) from a $3 million endowment fund for graduate fellowships and
bursaries, to be established with a gift from private donors and potentially matching funds
from the Manitoba Scholarship and Bursary Initiative.

Revenues identified above would be allocated to (i) salary and benefits for 1.0 FTE faculty
position (endowed chair) ($136,124), 1.0 FTE Program Coordinator ($84,277), and a 0.5 FTE
Office Assistant ($30,090); (ii) cover a total of 15 teaching-release credits for the graduate
program director, the Chair of a Co-ordinating Committee for Graduate Social Justice Programs,
and faculty teaching core courses in the program; (iii) fellowships and bursaries ($127,308);
(iv) operating costs ($32,393); and (v) central overhead costs ($89,498).

78

11.

It is anticipated that the M.H.R. program office would be located in the Tier Building, including
office space for two academic and two support staff members and study carrels for graduate
students. Funds ($402,900) would be required to renovate these spaces.

12.

The University Library has indicated that it could support the proposed program with the
purchase of fourteen monographs to address deficiencies in the current book collection. The
cost ($400) could be covered using existing resources.

13.

The SPPC noted that it would not be possible to implement the Master of Human Rights before
sufficient funds had been raised to support an endowed Chair. Proponents of the program
indicated that Donor Relations is confident that these funds can be raised through the current
Front and Centre capital campaign. It was noted that $500,000 had already been contributed
toward the endowment that would be used to offer fellowships and bursaries to students in the
program.

14.

On the basis of the SPPC’s criteria for assigning priority to new programs / initiatives, 1 the
Committee recommends that a high priority level be assigned to the proposal for a Master of
Human Rights, as the proposed program: is consistent with the existing institutional strategic
planning framework.

Recommendation
The Senate Planning and Priorities Committee recommends:
THAT Senate approve and recommend to the Board of Governors that it approve the
proposal to establish a Master of Human Rights. The Senate Committee on Planning and
Priorities recommends that the Vice-President (Academic) and Provost not implement
the program until satisfied that there would be sufficient space and sufficient funding to
support the ongoing operation of the program.

Respectfully submitted,
Ada Ducas, Chair

NEW PROGRAM OF 81
STUDY APPLICATION: MHR

SECTION B – PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND DELIVERY

B-1 Provide a general description of the program and its objectives: (Include intended purpose, curriculum design, and
highlight distinctive attributes)

Canada’s only Master of Human Rights degree program will equip graduates to help address the increasingly
complex human rights challenges of the 21st century. It will be broadly interdisciplinary and take advantage of
expertise in the University of Manitoba’s professional schools, including Law, Education and Social Work. The MHR
program will prepare students to integrate human rights perspectives into their careers in the private and/or public
sectors by developing research, advocacy and negotiation skills, as well as professional competencies. The program
will emphasize critical engagement with the conception, practice and institutionalization of human rights while
preparing students to make ethical, competent, innovative and effective contributions to human rights work
locally, nationally and globally.
The MHR pulls together existing human rights courses from numerous University of Manitoba faculties to form a
coherent program, with the addition of new core courses, a practicum, a major research project and a thesis
option.
Program Requirements
Minimum requirements of the Faculty of Graduate Studies are found in the Graduate Studies Master's Regulations
section of the University of Manitoba calendar. The MHR has the following additional requirements:
• Students will complete 18 course credits and one of the following:
o a practicum and a major research project or
o a thesis.
• The credit courses will consist of three required graduate courses and at least three additional graduatelevel (7000), law or post-baccalaureate (5000-level) courses from an approved list (see Appendix A).
• MHR students whose original language is English are required to demonstrate working knowledge of a
second language by the time of graduation. Note that American Sign Language is among the languages
recognized by the program. To satisfy the language requirement, students must either:
o provide evidence of competence in a second language, such as a high school graduation certificate
or transcript in that language, description of work experience in the second language or transcript
of advanced education in the second language; or
o pass a language competency test approved by the MHR program; or
o complete a program-approved language course and obtain a grade of B or better. This course will
be taken in addition to the 18 required course credits. Students who hope to work internationally
should consider selecting one of the official languages of the United Nations (Arabic, Chinese,
French, Russian and Spanish) or another world language such as German.
Governance
The MHR program will be a partnership between five faculties (Arts, Law, Education, Social Work, Graduate
Studies) and three centres (Centre for Human Rights Research, Mauro Centre for Peace and Justice and National
Centre for Truth and Reconciliation) at the University of Manitoba, with support from other faculties. (See first
page of the attached Supplemental Regulations for governance details.)
Location
The new program will be physically located on the Fort Garry campus near the offices and classrooms of partner
faculties Arts, Law and Social Work. The Campus Planning office is confident about finding wheelchairaccessible space that can be renovated at reasonable cost to accommodate two faculty members (the MHR
director and a new hire), two administrative staff and graduate student study carrels, with a wheelchairaccessible washroom in the same building. One space under consideration is on the third floor of the Tier
Building. Once the MHR program is approved and the timeline is confirmed, Campus Planning will revisit the
space and determine if an even more suitable location is available at that time.
NEW PROGRAM OF 82
STUDY APPLICATION: MHR

Admission
Admission requirements include those of the Faculty of Graduate Studies found in the Graduate Studies Master's
Regulations section of the University of Manitoba calendar. Additional requirements specific to this program are:
• A four-year bachelor’s degree with at least a B average (3.0 GPA) in the last 60 credit hours of study, to be
completed before admission. Note that, due to the competitive nature of the admissions process, students
with a higher GPA may have a greater chance of acceptance.
• English Language Proficiency at the same level as the Faculty of Law requires from LLM applicants. This is a
higher standard than the Faculty of Graduate Studies minimum.
• At least one undergraduate-level course in human rights or equivalent field experience is preferred.
• Two letters of reference.
• Statement of interest (maximum two pages) that includes reasons for seeking admission, an outline of the
applicant’s relevant background, a tentative indication of whether the student is likely to pursue a thesis or
practicum, and a potential thesis topic, if applicable.
B-2 Length of Program: (Define the length of the proposed program using measures appropriate to the schedule and
delivery format. This will include total course credits and weeks/months, and, where relevant, hours and semesters of instruction)
1. Practicum stream, which we expect will attract the majority of students: 16 months
2. Thesis stream: 16 to 24 months
B-3 Intended outcomes of the program:
B-3.1 Describe how this program serves and advances the academic, cultural, social and economic needs and interests
of students and the province:
Human rights figure increasingly prominently in politics, business, policy, law, education, civil society organizations and
movements for social change. The myriad of complex human rights issues confronting Manitoba, Canada and the world
are best tackled through a broad-based approach that spans histories, cultures and academic disciplines.
“What we’re looking for is a whole new generation of leaders who can in fact function in a
multidisciplinary context.”
Senator Roméo Dallaire, Oct. 5, 2012, Robson Hall
Manitoba’s needs
A coalition of local organizations is working on a plan to have Winnipeg emerge as a leading city for human rights
education; a Master of Human Rights program would be the capstone for this initiative.
The Government of Manitoba stated in its 2016 budget that new projects “will be reviewed to assess their return on
investment and social benefits.” The proposed MHR is an excellent example of social investment, since graduates will
help Manitobans overcome human rights barriers preventing them from flourishing and fully participating in public
life, including employment. This is especially important for those from vulnerable or historically marginalized groups
such as Indigenous people and immigrant newcomers. Given Canada’s changing demographics, as well as growing
awareness of the harmful legacies of Western imperialism and settler- colonialism, we need citizens, government and
non-government workers, and business leaders who deeply understand Indigenous, newcomer, disability, linguistic,
religious and gender rights and cultures. This is especially true in Manitoba, with its broad cultural and religious
diversity.
The swearing-in of Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister’s first cabinet at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in 2016
underscores the growing importance of human rights to the region.
Manitoban businesses operating globally also need to understand and contribute constructively to the complex human
rights dynamics in countries where they operate. The UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights adopted in
2011 reflect the ever-higher moral and political standards to which businesses and their leaders are being held. Meeting
NEW PROGRAM OF 83
STUDY APPLICATION: MHR

these standards, in foreign contexts as well as at home, is both a matter of fundamental justice and good economic
sense. When corporations’ interests converge with those of the people in whose communities
and on whose land they operate, everyone wins. MHR graduates who came to the program with a business
background will be well placed to assist corporations in understanding and enacting the specifics of this
convergence.
Manitoba Budget 2016 also emphasized that “priority will be placed on projects that leverage additional investment
from the public sector, private sector and/or other levels of government.” Private donors were the first to support the
MHR and a modest investment by the Manitoba government is expected to leverage almost $2 in donor-supported
annual funding for every $1 of government investment.
Meanwhile, international governmental and nongovernmental organizations related to human rights are proliferating as
world leaders begin to recognize that military intervention and financial aid tend to be ineffective in societies where
human rights are routinely violated. This has created a new class of international human rights workers and
administrators. Being well-represented in these international organizations will be critical to Canada’s presence and
influence in the global arena.
B-3.2

Describe the existing and anticipated post-secondary learning needs of students in Manitoba that this program
addresses and responds to:
Many Canadians now working in the human rights field studied overseas because they could not find suitable
interdisciplinary graduate programs in Canada. The MHR program will allow Manitoba to retain promising graduate
students who would otherwise leave to study elsewhere. Existing human rights courses at U of M have proven
popular, often attracting students from outside the departments offering the courses and meeting or exceeding their
enrolment limits.
Students are looking for degree programs that are relevant, practical and innovative. The MHR program will
prepare students to conduct and apply rigorous research in the field in ways intended to benefit people vulnerable
to human rights violations. The program will be known for critical and interdisciplinary engagement with human
rights history, politics and implementation, and also for its supportive environment, in which students from a broad
range of disciplines collaborate to enrich each other’s learning.
Graduates of related undergraduate programs at other Manitoba universities may be looking for advanced degree
opportunities to enhance their expertise and employability. For example,
• The University of Winnipeg offers BA programs in human rights and disability studies.
• Université de Saint-Boniface emphasizes human rights as part of its Canadian studies curriculum.
• Canadian Mennonite University (CMU) offers degrees in intercultural or international development
studies and peace and conflict transformation.
• University College of the North graduates may wish to pursue further education with an Indigenous rights
focus.
A news story about this new program on the University of Manitoba website attracted queries from students from
across Canada and around the world who are interested in applying. The opening of the Canadian Museum for Human
Rights and the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation at the U of M has increased our capacity to attract graduate
students to a city already known as the cradle of the Canadian disability rights movement. The museum is among the
local employers that will provide opportunities for student research projects and jobs for some MHR graduates.
Based on the experience of popular human rights graduate programs in other countries, the MHR program is expected
to attract not only those who are continuing their education immediately following a bachelor’s degree, but also
people with significant life experience who wish to return to graduate studies. Some students will likely want to
enhance previous professional training in diverse areas such as public administration, health, business, law
enforcement, disability issues, journalism, the military and education. The program is expected to attract people from
Canada, the U.S., post-conflict zones, low-income countries, and others throughout the world who
NEW PROGRAM OF 84
STUDY APPLICATION: MHR

seek work or who are already working in human rights-related areas and/or decolonization efforts. As word of this
new program spreads, the calibre of applicants will continue to rise. Manitoba’s tuition fees are much lower than
the international student fees of overseas human rights programs, helping make the U of M program competitive
internationally. The former director of a Human Rights Centre in England reports receiving 110 applications for a
new graduate program even before it was established. He says thousands of students per year are graduating
from such programs around the world, leaving Canadian universities behind. One of Canada’s most senior
international human rights scholars adds that “it is frustrating to have to tell students that to do an MHR, they
have to go overseas.”
The opportunity for community-based work experience and research with local, national or international human
rights organizations is expected to be a major draw for top-quality students. Marcia Kran, a University of
Manitoba alumna who is former director of research at the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights in Geneva, has agreed to act as a pro bono special advisor to help the MHR program create
partnerships with the UN at headquarters and in the field.
Graduates will gain an in-depth understanding of the potential, politics, challenges and limitations of the human
rights framework. Students will develop a network of contacts through research projects and collaboration with
fellow students. Over the years, graduates will also start providing practicum opportunities and mentorship for
new students.
B-4 Mode of Delivery
B-4.1 Provide the total program length through one of the following measures:

18 credit hours + practicum/major research project or thesis
What proportion of the total program length (as indicated above) can be completed through the two
following modes of delivery? (Note that one or both selections can be offered up to the total program length.)
B-4.2

100% In-person
0% Online
As the program evolves, the intention is to eventually develop blended learning options that allow students to
participate through a combination of on-campus classes and up to 30% online work. This will facilitate a truly
international program, with growing ties for collaborative global coursework and student research projects. Prof.
Karen Busby is already experimenting with a sexual and reproductive rights course to be offered in collaboration with
a University in India.
B-5 Provide an overview of the suggested progression of courses on a year-by-year basis for the program from start to
maturity. (Course level detail is not necessary, however, please include credit hours/contact hours, proportion of upper level courses,
clinical placements or practicums, or subject area requirements where applicable).

Required courses (see attached details)
HMRT 7100/SOC 7160: Theory and Practice of Human Rights: Critical Perspectives (3 credit hours). Students who
have already completed SOC 7160 prior to enrolling in the MHR program will be required, in consultation with
the MHR program committee, to take an additional graduate-level course to achieve the 18 required credits.
HMRT 7200: Selected Topics in Human Rights Research and Methods (3 credit hours)
HMRT 7300/LAW 3018: Human Rights Law (3 credit hours) Students are not required to take this course if they

GRAD 7030: Master’s Practicum
Students who select this stream will complete a practicum of at least three months duration. Major outcomes
include the student’s participation in a professional work environment and preparation of a reflective paper
describing and evaluating the work experience. The practicum consists of three main phases, the most
substantial of which is structured employment, usually without pay, at a local, national or international
practicum site, typically a non-governmental organization. Students will be asked to make a specific positive
contribution to the operation of their host organizations in the form of a report, curriculum module, work of art,
documentary film, workshop, website, strategic plan, or other such project. A few students may choose to help
organize a planned summer institute on human rights as their university-based placement. Prior to the start of
this field experience, students will spend two to three weeks orienting themselves regarding the organization.
The third phase involves writing a reflective paper of approximately 4,000 words.

SECTION C – INFORMATION REGARDING PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT PHASE
C-1 Describe how this new program aligns with the strategic plans of your institution:
The U of Manitoba has identified human rights as one of its six strategic priorities for academic enhancement and
one of seven major research themes. The university has also set ambitious targets to increase the number of
graduate students enrolled. The MHR practicum fits well with the university’s 2015-2020 strategic plan, which
includes increasing opportunities for experiential learning as one of its goals. The strategic plan identifies five
broader institutional priorities, among them inspiring students through innovative teaching, contributing to
Indigenous achievement, and forging connections through high-impact community engagement. The proposed
MHR program would contribute significantly towards realizing these and other institutional objectives.
Many U of M faculty are already widely known for their work on and with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. The work of MHR students and faculty will build on this tradition of
scholarly excellence related to social justice issues, promoting the university’s reputation nationally and
internationally. The proposed program will help achieve the critical mass necessary to make Winnipeg the leading
centre of excellence for human rights education and research in Canada. This profile will in turn enhance the
University of Manitoba’s ability to attract high-calibre faculty members and research grants.
C-2 Outline the internal approval process (i.e. committees, governing bodies) for approving this new program of
study within your institution and indicate any dates of decision. (Governing Council, Board of Governors, Board of Regents,

NEW PROGRAM OF 88
STUDY APPLICATION: MHR

What agencies, groups, or institutions have been consulted regarding the development of this program?
See attached support letters (Appendix C) from some of the local, national and international human rights
agencies consulted. Prof. Karen Busby also met with Dr. Dinesh Wadiwel, director of the University of Sydney’s
Master of Human Rights program, and Dr. Adam Muller met with Barbara Frey, director of the Human Rights
Program at the University of Minnesota.
C-3.2

How have students and faculty been informed of the intent to establish this program?
The faculties contributing to the program (Arts, Law, Education and Social Work) were consulted in the early
stages of program development and provided motions and letters of support (Appendix B).
The University of Manitoba issued a news release in 2014 (http://news.umanitoba.ca/university-of-manitobadeveloping-a-master-of-human-rights-program/), which was followed by a story in the student newspaper
(http://www.themanitoban.com/2014/09/pursuit-human-rights-established-u-m/20732).
C-3.3

C-4 List any similar programs offered in Manitoba: (Provide such information as institution, programs, and credentials
offered in addition to any impacts on these programs, explain rationale for duplication.)

BA in Human Rights, University of Winnipeg
The proposed MHR program will provide BA graduates with the opportunity to pursue an advanced degree. The
BA and MHR programs expect to collaborate on joint projects and events. See the attached support letter from
Dean Peachey.
Joint MA in Peace and Conflict Studies, U of Manitoba/U of Winnipeg
PhD in Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Manitoba
Disability Studies, University of Manitoba
The Master of Human Rights program provides another opportunity for the U of M’s existing interdisciplinary
graduate programs to work together, sharing elective courses and guest lectures and thus providing a deeper
experience for students. We have had preliminary discussions about creating a new Co-ordinating Committee
for Graduate Social Justice (SJ) Programs (human rights, peace & conflict and disability studies) to make
administration of these small units more efficient (see Appendix D).
While there are some synergies between human rights and peace and conflict studies (PACS), they are distinct
fields with their own histories, philosophies and methods. Consequently, these distinct fields attract different
students interested in distinct kinds of professional and academic work. For example, PACS is more likely to
emphasize the pragmatics of peace-building and reconciliation, mainly in community contexts. The MHR will
range more widely and critically across a diversity of rights-related justice issues arising in: political and
vernacular social discourses and action, academic debates, national and transnational institutions, nongovernmental organizations and social movements, and courts of law.
Students enrolled in other graduate U of M degree programs will be able to take advantage of the MHR courses,
thus enhancing and diversifying their educational experience.
Master’s in Development Practice (Indigenous development), University of Winnipeg
This program has a much narrower focus than the proposed program since it is largely related to sustainable
economic development in Indigenous communities. However, there is certainly potential for collaboration with
the MHR program.
Describe any specific laddering, articulation and/or credit transfer options for students that are anticipated
in this program in Manitoba.
Graduate courses from other programs will be considered for transfer on a case-by-case basis. The program will
follow the transfer criteria described in the University of Manitoba Graduate Calendar. The program will also

develop means to recognize students' relevant non-formal and informal learning, consistent with the University
of Manitoba and the Province of Manitoba's commitment to recognition of prior learning.
C-5 List any similar programs offered in Canada: (Provide such information as institution, programs, and credentials offered in
addition to any impacts on these programs, explain rationale for duplication.)
The proposed MHR program will provide some graduates of these BA programs with the opportunity to pursue
an advanced degree:
• Wilfrid Laurier University – Human Rights and Human Diversity
• York University – Human Rights and Equity Studies
• Carleton University – Human Rights
• University of Ottawa – Conflict Studies and Human Rights
• Nipissing University – Gender Equality and Social Justice
• Concordia University – Human Rights Studies
• St. Thomas University – Human Rights
This will be the only Master of Human Rights degree program in Canada, although degrees of that name are
popular in Europe, the United States and Australia. While some of the Canadian graduate programs listed below
have a similar focus, none involve the degree of interdisciplinarity and trans-faculty engagement offered by the
proposed MHR. Note that none of the following programs are offered on the Prairies.
Canadian law programs:
• University of Toronto – JD in International Human Rights
• McGill University – LLB in International Human Rights and Development
• University of Ottawa – LLM with a concentration in Social Justice
Canadian graduate programs:
• Brock University – MA in Social Justice and Equity Studies
• University of British Columbia – MA and PhD in Gender, Race, Sexuality and Social Justice
• University of Windsor – MA in Communications and Social Justice
• Wilfred Laurier University – MA in Social Justice and Community Engagement
• University of Alberta – MA in Gender and Social Justice Studies
• Carleton University – PhD in political science with a specialization in gender and diversity

C-6 Describe the current and projected labour market demands in Manitoba for graduates of this Program:
(Provide such information as probable employment destinations or further educational opportunities available to graduates of t his
new program of study. Attach any formal reports such as those from Associations, Statistics Canada, Sector Councils, Industry or
Regulators.)

In December 2016, the Working in Canada website listed 44 positions for social policy researchers, consultants
and program officers, including human rights officers. The median wage was $31 an hour. It is expected that the
balance between labour supply and demand for this group (NOC 4164) will continue over the 2015-2024 period.

NEW PROGRAM OF 90
STUDY APPLICATION: MHR

Graduates of the MHR program who remain in Manitoba will be able to use their research skills, and national and
international connections, to strengthen local organizations, thus helping find innovative solutions to local
problems and expanding the province’s growing reputation as a human rights hub. Some graduates will influence
the development of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights and National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation.
Many of the Manitoba-based jobs will be in Winnipeg with aid agencies such as the Canadian Foodgrains Bank and
Mennonite Central Committee and with federal and provincial government departments. However, some
graduates will help enhance human rights and social justice in northern or rural Manitoba.
The MHR program will prepare its graduates for numerous career paths – for example with:
Civil society organizations, including Amnesty International, International Alert, Friends of the Earth, Human
Rights Watch, Asian Human Rights Commission, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
Red Cross, Red Crescent, OutRight Action International, Council of Canadians with Disabilities, International
Crisis Group, Centre for Victims of Torture, Human Rights Action Centre, the Simon Wiesenthal Centre and
various think tanks;
• Governmental and international or regional organizations such as the United Nations Human Rights Council,
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, International Criminal Court, Council of Europe Commissioner
for Human Rights, UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, bodies of the Inter-American Human
Rights system, World Trade Organization and World Bank panels, and provincial and Canadian government
departments of immigration, justice, health, corrections, social services etc.;
• Canadian human rights commissions, labour boards, ombudspersons and organizations devoted to securing
Indigenous people’s rights, cultural diversity, gender equality, and LGBTQ and disabled people’s rights;
• Primary and secondary schools or institutions of higher education, to design and implement programs/curricula
addressing human rights education;
• Corporations that choose to take human rights into account in their local, national and international operations;
• Arts organizations with human rights or social justice mandates, such as various provincial and municipal arts
councils, the Inspirit Foundation, Abilities Arts Festival, Art City, etc.

•

Writing a thesis or preparation of an article suitable for journal submission through the HMRT 7400 course will also
prepare students for related PhD studies in pursuit of an academic career.
C-7 If copies of any internal or peer evaluations with respect to this new program of study are being provided with
this proposal, please indicated how any issues identified by these evaluations have been addressed and attach any
relevant documents as available:
External review (Appendix G) recommendations
1. Elimination of the heavy thesis requirement – replacing the long thesis requirement by a standard research
paper.
In response to this recommendation, program proponents chose to create two streams: practicum + major
research project or thesis. The maximum length of the thesis has been reduced from 150 pages to 100 pages,
including references. The thesis defence will be shortened to one hour.
2. Move to a 12- or 16-month program from proposed 24-month program. I.e. 16 months for most students, 12
months if practicum waived because of previous professional work experience.
Major research project stream students will now complete the program in 16 months and thesis students in 1624 months. We disagree with waiving the practicum for students with previous professional experience. Those
students may either choose the thesis option or complete a practicum that may be quite different from their
previous professional experience and provide inspiration for the major research project.
3. Strong grounding in knowledge of international law and systems for the protection of human rights
(including universal, regional and domestic levels).

The syllabuses for HMRT 7300: Human Rights Law and HMRT 7100: Theory and Practice of Human Rights:
Critical Perspectives have been revised to integrate discussions of international human rights law and
systems, and POLS 7790: International Relations Theory has been added as an elective. However, program
proponents respectfully disagree with the suggestion of creating a fourth mandatory course on this topic,
which would allow students only two elective courses and therefore little opportunity to specialize. We note
that the reviewers also stated that opportunities for employment are increasingly in the “burgeoning ‘third
sector’ of non-governmental organizations, civil society and community-based organizations” rather than
with international human rights bodies.
Training in different types of professional skills, notably writing.
Professional development seminars will now be mandatory, though non-credit, with a strong focus on nonacademic writing and communication skills.
Practicum and/or internship (international strongly recommended).
Program proponents are enthusiastic about implementing this recommendation, which we agree is likely to
make the MHR program unique in Canada and more appealing to potential students. Faculty members on the
proposal committee already have ties to local, national and international sites that would be suitable for
practicums, including organizations offering practicum placements in the attached support letters.
Second-language requirement strongly recommended.
The revised proposal now includes a second-language requirement that must be satisfied in order to for the
student to complete the program.
Addition of further courses (notably, environment, business ethics, human security).
POLS 7850 - Contemporary Strategic and Security Studies has been added to the list of potential electives.
U of M does not offer any graduate-level business ethics courses. However, more material on corporate ethics
has been added to the MHR theory course.
Four Natural Resources Institute courses, including on environmental justice and food security, are already in the
proposal. We are not aware of any other U of M graduate courses related to the human right to a healthy
environment, although we will keep this in mind as opportunities arise to develop further courses.
Hiring a new professor who can teach both research methods in human rights (as per the proposal) and a
course on the international, regional, and domestic systems for the protection of human rights.
This recommendation has been incorporated in the description of the new assistant professor below.
Removing the word “practice” from the title of the MHR theory course.
We have chosen to keep this word in the title because the course includes examination of human rights
struggles.
Adding another half-time position to help with the practicums and/or internships, which will be especially
important in the initial years when placement relationships will need to be established.
The current proposal adds a half-time office assistant, which should free the full-time co-ordinator to focus on
successfully performing a significant additional support role. The office assistant will perform various
administrative and reporting tasks so as to allow the full-time person to contribute to developing and sustaining
the practicum option, a distinctive feature of the MHR program.
It is important that the program not be underfunded; rather, the university should take a bold approach. We
suggest that the eight $2,500 scholarships originally proposed for research should also be available for
internships. Moreover, we suggest that fund-raisers be instructed to seek support at the level of $5,000 each for
each year’s annual intake of 15 students to pursue practicums or internships. There should also be funds made
available for invited guest lecturers and other events in order to enrich the program and assure the highest
quality which would be competitive with leading, established programs in the world.
In consultation with Donor Relations, the fundraising target for student fellowships and bursaries has been
increased. The budget for visiting speakers has also been modestly increased.

D-5 What are the resource implications to the institution (budget, IT, library, laboratory, computer, space, practicum
liability insurance, student services, etc) in delivering this new program of study?
Budget: The new MHR program does not anticipate a cash contribution from the university.
Space: Renovations are required in the Tier Building to convert rooms 311 and 312 into space for student
study carrels, two faculty offices and a double staff office (see Appendix E). Once the MHR program is
approved and the timeline is confirmed, Campus Planning will revisit the space and determine if an even
more suitable location is available at that time.
Computer:
• New desktop computers and phones will be required for the co-ordinator, office assistant, new assistant
professor and MHR program director.
• A new printer/fax/scanner will be required for the program.
• A separate printer will be required in the staff office for confidential materials.
IT: The new program should have no significant effect on information services and technology facilities. (See
attached letter from IST.)
Libraries: The U of M library system can support this new program with a combination of existing resources and
minimal ($400) expenditure from existing acquisition funds. (See attached resource implication statement.)
Student services: The Registrar foresees no problems supporting this program with respect to registration, fee
assessment and academic evaluation. (See attached letter from Registrar)
D-6 Please describe new and existing staffing resources needed to provide this new program of study. Include
reallocation of existing faculty, hiring of new faculty, administrative and support services and any other considerations.

Reallocation of existing faculty:
An existing University of Manitoba faculty member will be appointed as founding MHR graduate program director.
Dr. Adam Muller has expressed interest in this role. The MHR graduate program director, the chair of a new Coordinating Committee for Graduate Social Justice Programs and professors teaching core MHR courses will receive
teaching release from the MHR budget, with the related funds redirected to their home departments.
The theory and methods courses will be taught by a rotating roster of interested professors from the partner
faculties, including the MHR graduate program director and a new assistant professor. Dr. Annette Desmarais
(Canada Research Chair in Human Rights, Social Justice and Food Sovereignty) and Dr. Adam Muller have already
expressed interest in teaching theory and leading professional seminars. Canadian Museum for Human Rights
curator Armando Perla is currently teaching LAW 3018, which will become the third core course.
Faculty members in a number of disciplines are eager to take on additional graduate students beyond those they are
able to recruit through their departments. More than 50 faculty members have agreed to serve as advisors for
student research. (See Appendix F). In most cases, they will do so without receiving additional teaching release.

NEW PROGRAM OF 94
STUDY APPLICATION: MHR

Hiring of new faculty:
A new tenure-track assistant professor will be hired as a named chair and appointed to whichever academic
department is most closely aligned with her/his area of expertise. A letter of agreement will outline the chair’s
relationship with the department, including that its tenure and promotion procedures will apply. Candidates for the
new position will require expertise in human rights and social justice research methods and international, regional
and domestic human rights systems. This chair will teach a core credit course (initially methods), oversee the
practicum and explore development of further courses, including online options.
Administrative services:
A new full-time co-ordinator (Admin. Assistant 2 in the AESES contract) will be hired to support the MHR program,
including liaison with practicum hosts, trouble-shooting fieldwork logistics, and organizing professional seminars and
the annual research day. This position might be best suited to a dynamic individual with a background in human
rights work. A half-time office assistant (Office Assistant 3) will assist with tasks such as expense reporting, payroll,
student awards and travel booking. These staff members will also support the Social Justice chair and will work
closely with existing office assistants in PACS and Disability Studies.
D-7 Provide a program implementation plan for the new program of study by academic year (start to maturity) that
includes any elements to be phased in (e.g., new faculty hires, distribution of existing faculty and support staff) from
launch to maturity:
Year 1 2019-20

Faculty of Graduate Studies
Name of Unit: Master of Human Rights
Faculty of Graduate Studies Regulation

Supplemental Regulation

The Faculty of Graduate Studies academic guide contains all the rules and policies pertaining to
the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Adherence to these rules is of utmost importance for the
effective functioning/operation of programs and for guiding and monitoring the progress of
students. The integrity of the process is at stake. The major goal of this guide is to prevent
potential problems that may affect the completion of a student’s program. It is the responsibility
of students and the unit offering a graduate program to read and follow the policies contained
herein.
All regulations as laid out in the Faculty of Graduate Studies Academic Guide are subject to
revision by the appropriate bodies of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. This compendium is
presented as the most recent set of regulations as a guideline for students and staff. Regulations
may vary from one department or program to another. Individual departments may have
additional regulations that supplement these general regulations. All such supplementary
procedures and regulations must be approved as specified by the By-Laws of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies, be published and available to students, and kept on file in the Faculty of
Graduate Studies Office.
For those programs that are administered through a Faculty (as opposed to a Department) the
term “Department” should be substituted by “Unit” within this document (i.e. Department Head
becomes Unit Head.)

PREFACE
The Faculty of Graduate Studies is a pan-University faculty charged with the oversight of the
administration of all graduate programs at the University. Therefore these regulations apply to all
graduate students in all programs in all academic units. Individual units may require specific
requirements above and beyond those in the following document, and students should consult
unit supplemental regulations for these specific regulations. All unit supplemental regulations
require approval of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Definitions

The Master of Human Rights (MHR) program committee
consists of:
Voting members:
the MHR program director (who will chair
the committee)
a core MHR faculty member
an Arts professor appointed by the Dean of Arts
a Law professor appointed by the Dean of Law
an Education professor appointed by the Dean of
Education
a Social Work professor appointed by the
Dean of Social Work
(The four faculty representatives should, ideally, have
adjunct appointments in the MHR program.)
an MHR graduate student elected by the
MHR graduate student body. This student
will only participate in discussions unrelated
to confidential student files.
Non-voting members:
the director of the Centre for Human Rights
Research;
a representative of the National Centre for
Truth and Reconciliation;
the director of the Mauro Centre for Peace and
Justice.
The program committee will oversee student admission,
scholarships, policy, recommendation of program
changes and new courses, monitoring of student progress
and general administration of the MHR program.

The “Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies” shall be taken to mean the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies or designate.
“Unit” shall be taken to mean the academic unit where the graduate student is pursuing his/her
studies. Generally, this is the department. For Faculty-based programs, the Dean is the de facto
Head of the unit. The term “unit” shall also include Schools of Faculties within the
University. The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies is the de facto Head of interdisciplinary
programs administered by the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The Head of any unit may designate
any of his/her responsibilities in this policy to another member of the unit, such as the Graduate
Chair.

Section 1: Application, Admission, and Registration Policies

1.1.12 Eligibility of University of Manitoba Staff Members
A staff member at the University of Manitoba at the rank of Assistant Professor or above is not
eligible to apply for admission to a graduate program in the unit in which the appointment is held.
1.2 Registration Procedures
1.2.1 Registration
Undergraduate students are not allowed to register in graduate courses; that is, admission to the
Faculty of Graduate Studies is a condition for registration in courses at the 6000 level and above.
All graduate students must initially register in the term specified in their letter of acceptance as
specified in the Academic Schedule of the Graduate Calendar. Any student not registering by
registration deadline for the term specified in their letter of offer will be required to re-apply for
admission. In exceptional circumstances and with prior approval from the unit, a student may
defer registration for up to one term following acceptance into the Faculty of Graduate Studies. In
the case of international students, admission may be deferred, with prior approval from the unit,
for up to one year following acceptance.
All programs must be approved by the Head of the major unit or designate. Approval to
take courses from units outside the major unit must be obtained from the outside unit.
The approval or denial of admission and registration to two programs rests with the Dean of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies in consultation with the unit concerned. The approval/denial must be
submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies prior to the student’s admission/registration.
Where a student does register in two programs, the student must declare themself as part-time
in at least one of the programs. Students should note that completing a graduate program as a
part-time student will affect their eligibility for the University of Manitoba Graduate Fellowship
(UMGF) and may limit other funding possibilities.
1.2.2 Re-Registration
Any student whose program of study extends for more than one year must re-register in both the
fall and winter terms of each succeeding year of his/her program until a degree is obtained (or in
the case of pre-Master’s students, their program is completed). Failure to re-register will result
in the discontinuation of his/her graduate status. A student who has been discontinued and
would like to be considered for continuation in a program must apply for re-admission, which is
not guaranteed. The re-registration requirement does not apply to occasional students, visiting
students, pre-Master’s students or students on an Exceptional or Parental Leave of Absence
(please refer to “Leave of Absence”, Section 8 of this Guide).
The notation ‘Discontinued Graduate Program’ will be placed on the academic record of any
graduate student who has failed to maintain continuous registration.

Note:
Blue-shaded boxes must be filled in. Yellow-shaded boxes must be filled in if a unit offers that specific program
route (i.e. Comprehensive Examination route)

103

Supplemental Regulation

1.2.3 Registration Revisions
For designated periods subsequent to registration, approved revisions may be made. It is
required that students adhere to dates and deadlines as published in the Academic Schedule of
the Graduate Academic Calendar.
Note: Graduate students are not permitted to withdraw from courses without written permission
from their unit Head on recommendation from their advisor/advisory committee. The notation
“Required to Withdraw” will be placed on the academic record of any graduate student who has
withdrawn from courses without such approval.
1.2.4 Advisor Student Guidelines
All students in thesis/practicum programs, in consultation with their advisor, are required to
complete the Advisor Student Guidelines as soon as possible after registration but no later than
at the time of submission of the first Progress Report. The Advisor Student Guidelines form is
available through JUMP.
1.2.5. Western Deans’ Agreement
This agreement was established in 1974 as an expression of co-operation and mutual support
among universities offering graduate programs in western Canada. Its primary purpose is the
reciprocal enrichment of graduate programs throughout western Canada. This agreement is not
intended to preclude other agreements between participating institutions.
1.2.5.1 The Western Deans’ Agreement normally provides an automatic tuition fee waiver for
visiting students. Graduate students paying normal required tuition fees to their home institution
will not pay tuition fees to the host institution.
1.2.5.2 Program fees are always to be paid to the home institution, regardless of coursework
taken at another institution. Students may be required to pay student, activity, application, or
other ancillary fees to the host institution, according to general policies in effect at the host
institution. Wherever possible, these fees will also be waived.
1.2.5.3 Students will qualify for the fee waiver if they:
a) present the “Authorization Form: Western Deans’ Agreement” signed by the Dean or
designate and the unit Head or advisor of a participating Western institution specifying the
courses to be taken for credit toward a graduate degree program at their home institution;
b) are in good standing in a graduate program at the home institution;
c) have paid all current and back fees at the home institution.
1.2.5.4 Students must meet all requirements as prescribed by the host university’s regulations,
deadlines, class capacities, and course prerequisites.
1.2.5.5 Registration is possible in courses at both the graduate and undergraduate levels, and in
credit courses offered through distance education or other means. To be eligible, courses must
be an integral part of the applicant’s graduate degree program. Fee waiver is not permitted for
audit or non-credit courses.
1.2.5.6 Students must have the Authorization Form approved by the relevant unit Head and the
Faculty of Graduate Studies at the host institution at least two weeks prior to the commencement
of the course(s) requested. The fee waiver is not available retroactively.
1.2.5.7 Students are subject to regulations of the home institution governing credit for the
courses to be undertaken. As a condition of registration at the host institution, students will

arrange for official transcripts from the host institution to be sent to the home institution
confirming successful completion of courses selected.
1.2.5.8 Students must send confirmation of registration and notice of any change to the graduate
Records Office of the home institution at the time of registration or course change is completed.
1.2.5.9 Students may not claim fee waivers under the terms of this Agreement for a period of
more than 12 months in total.
1.2.5.10 Each institution has its own regulations regarding the maximum number of transfer
credits permitted in a given degree program. A list of the participating Universities can be found
at http://wcdgs.ca/
1.3 Course Classifications
1.3.1 General Classifications
Students who register through Aurora Student Information System (Aurora Student) must also
have prior approval of the unit Head or designate. Students registering through Aurora Student
should add only those courses that are a Major course in their program. Courses with Auxiliary
“X”, Audit “A”, or Occasional “O” status (see below) must be added by the unit.
“X” Auxiliary course: Course is not a major requirement of the program but is required by the
student’s advisor.** Extra courses that are not part of the Master’s or Ph.D. program but which
are specified and required by the student’s advisor, may be classified as X (Auxiliary) and the
grade will not be included in the degree GPA which appears on the transcript. However, X
course grades may be used in the calculation of the GPA for continuation in the program and a
minimum grade requirement may be required for X coursework by the unit. (Please consult the
individual unit’s supplemental regulations.) Additionally, X courses are used in the calculation of
the GPA for the purposes of Admission and Awards. (The University of Manitoba Graduate
Fellowship (UMGF) and International Graduate Student Scholarship (IGSS) use X courses in the
calculation of the GPA.) The student’s advisor and unit Head must determine if there is a valid
need for the registration in courses under the X classification. A maximum of 12 credit hours
under the X course classification is permitted while registered in a given program.
“A” Audit course: Course is not taken for credit. No grade is recorded. Additional fees will be
assessed.
“O” Occasional course: Course is not a requirement of the program. Additional fees will be
assessed.
** Note: Changes in course classifications are regarded as course/program changes and may
not be made without approval (refer to the “Registration Revision” section of this Guide) or after
the deadline dates for course changes as indicated in the Academic Schedule of the Calendar.
1.3.2 Continuing Courses (CO)
For those graduate level courses (6000, 7000, and 8000) which are being taken by students
enrolled in the Faculty of Graduate Studies and which continue beyond the normal academic term,
the instructor shall recommend that a mark classification of “CO” be used until such time as a final
grade can be established. If the course is not completed by August 31, the student must
re-register for the course(s).
In the absence of an assigned mark of “CO”, the student may receive a mark of “F” in that term.
Note: A CO will normally not be permitted longer than twelve months. In exceptional
circumstances, where a CO grade is requested for a second twelve months, at the time the CO
grade is submitted, the instructor and unit Head must also submit the “Recommendation for
Continuing Status of a Course” form stating the reason for the CO and the deadline by which the

course must be completed.
1.3.3 Incomplete Courses
Students who are unable to complete the term work prescribed in a course may apply to the
instructor prior to the end of term for consideration of a grade classification of “Incomplete”. It is
understood that the student is to write the final examination if one is scheduled for the course.
Taking into account the results of the final examination, the value of the term work completed,
and the extent of the incomplete term work, the instructor shall calculate the temporary grade
using a zero value for incomplete work.
Normally, the following maximum extensions are allowed:
August 1st for courses terminated in April
December 1st for courses terminated in August
April 1st for courses terminated in December
If a final grade is not reported within one month of the extension deadline, the Incomplete (I)
classification will be dropped and the grade will remain as awarded. The student will no longer
have an opportunity to improve the grade. In no case will the satisfaction of the incomplete
requirements result in a lower grade being awarded.
1.4 Student Status/Categories of Students

Note: New calculation of full time equivalency of parttime status

1.4.1 Full-Time And Part-Time Students
Graduate students who are participating in studies on a regular basis in an academic term and/or
are registered in the academic year are considered to be full-time students. Graduate student
status is not determined by the number of credit hours taken per term. Therefore, such students
who spend much of the time in a laboratory or library engaged in research or writing a
thesis/practicum, or who spend part of the academic year engaged in research elsewhere, are
regarded as full-time students.
Student status should be determined by the student and advisor/co-advisor, and changes must be
requested on the “Change of Status” form
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). The form must be approved by
the unit Head and submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Declaration of full/part time status must be made prior to the end of the registration revision
period in the Fall and/or Winter terms and within one month of the start of the Summer term.
For every full year (twelve months) a Master’s student is declared as part time they will
receive an additional four months in time to complete their program. For every two years
(24 months) a Master’s student is declared as part time they will receive an additional year
(12 months) in time to complete their program. For every two years (24 months) a Ph.D.
student is declared as part time they will receive an additional four months in time to
complete their program. Retroactive status changes will not be made.
1.4.2 Pre-Master’s Or Qualifying Students
In specific cases where the academic background of the student is judged to be insufficient for
the given program in a unit, the unit may recommend that the student be admitted to a preMaster’s program of study. The pre-Master’s program is intended to bring the student’s standing
to approximately the level of an Honours graduate in the major unit, and to provide any
necessary prerequisites for courses.

1.4.3 Occasional Students
A student wishing to take graduate courses with no intention of applying them toward an
advanced degree at the University of Manitoba is classified as an occasional student. Occasional
students must meet the same degree and grade point average entrance requirements as regular
graduate students and must write final examinations in the courses taken (unless audited), but
will not receive credit toward a degree. In special circumstances, an occasional student may
apply for permission to proceed to a degree program and also apply for transfer, for credit, of
courses previously taken in the occasional category. Note:
1. Transfer of courses from the “occasional” category to a degree program is not automatic:
request for advance credit must be made within the first year of a degree program.
2. Fees paid by a student while registered as an occasional student are not transferable, at a
later date, to a degree program.
3. Registration in the occasional student category can be for no more than one academic year
without reapplication.
4. At least 60% of coursework per academic year must be taken at the graduate level while
registered as an occasional student.
1.4.4 Joint Masters (With the University of Winnipeg)
The University of Manitoba and the University of Winnipeg offer four joint Master’s programs:
History, Religion, Public Administration, and Peace and Conflict Studies. The University of
Manitoba Faculty of Graduate Studies is responsible for the administration of the joint programs,
and students must complete the regular University of Manitoba application and registration forms.
Students taking pre-Master’s qualifying work for these programs register at the university where
the courses are being taken.
1.4.5 Visiting Students
Visiting students are students who are registered at another institution who are taking one or
more courses at the University of Manitoba on a Letter of Permission from their home university.
Visiting students must submit an application form, along with a $100.00 (CDN) application fee, in
addition to copies of transcripts from all institutions attended and a successfully completed
English Language Proficiency Test from the approved list, if applicable. Applications should be
submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies prior to the start of the intended term of study.
SECTION 2: Academic Performance - General
2.1 General Note
Students are ultimately responsible for ensuring that they meet all degree and program
requirements. The advisor (and if appropriate co-advisor), advisory committee, and unit must
ensure that each student follows the guidelines and meets the program requirements. The
Faculty of Graduate Studies performs a final check of program requirements for each student
just prior to graduation. Students are cautioned, therefore, to periodically check all regulations
with respect to the degree requirements. Failure to meet all the requirements will render a
student ineligible to graduate.

4.7.3, and for information specific to the Ph.D. use
section (box) 5.6; for information common to both
programs, use this box; if this box is used, put
references to this section in 4.7.3 and 5.6.

Units may make recommendations with respect to the regulations concerning minimum
academic performance; however, enforcement of academic regulations rests with the Faculty of
Graduate Studies. The following procedures apply to recommendations made by units:
The unit is responsible for informing the Faculty of Graduate Studies when a student’s
performance is unsatisfactory in research or coursework and the unit must outline any
recommended remedial action(s).

107

FGS Template updated August 2014

Faculty of Graduate Studies Regulation

Supplemental Regulation

The unit must notify the student of the deficiency and of its recommendation.
If the student fails to satisfy any remedial action recommended, the student may be required to
withdraw from the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Note:
When a graduate student is required to withdraw from a program of study, the notation on the
academic record will be: “Required to withdraw”. Voluntary withdrawal from a program is only
permitted if the student is in good academic standing.
Recommendations of units will supersede student requests for voluntary withdrawal.
A student who has been required to withdraw from a graduate program at The University of
Manitoba may be permitted to apply for admission to another graduate program only if the
application for admission is approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
2.2 Academic Performance

Note: Progress Reports may be submitted more than
annually

Student progress shall be reported at least annually to the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the
“Progress Report” form (http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html).
Students who fail to maintain satisfactory performance may be required to withdraw on the
recommendation of the Graduate Chair/unit Head to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies
on the “Progress Report” form. Two consecutive “in need of improvements” normally requires the
student to withdraw.
2.3 Performance in Coursework
A minimum degree grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 with no grade below C+ must be maintained
to continue in the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Units may specify, in their supplementary
regulations, standards that are higher than those of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Students
who fail to maintain the specified grades will be required to withdraw unless a unit recommends
remedial action. Any such action must be approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies.

For information specific to the Master’s use section (box)
4.7.4, and for information specific to the Ph.D. use
section (box) 5.6.1; for information common to both
programs, use this box; if this box is used, put
references to this section in 4.7.4 and 5.6.1.

A student may be permitted to remove deficiencies in grades by repeating the course or
replacing it with an equivalent substitute course. Each failed course may be repeated or replaced
only once, to a maximum of 6 credit hours of coursework. If a course is repeated or replaced, the
most recent grade obtained will be used in the determination of the degree grade point average.
Students receiving a grade of C or less in more than 6 credit hours of coursework are required to
withdraw, unless otherwise stated in the unit’s supplemental regulations. Note:
In exceptional circumstances, the unit may appeal to the Faculty of Graduate Studies for
approval of remedial recommendation(s) falling outside those prescribed above.
Supplemental exams are not permitted to students in the Master’s or Ph.D. program, unless
otherwise stated in the unit’s supplemental regulations.
All actions taken administratively are to be reported, in summary form, to the Faculty of Graduate
Studies Executive Committee.
SECTION 3: General Regulations: Pre-Master’s
There is no pre-master’s program in MHR.
3.1 Admission and Program Requirements
Graduates of bachelor degree programs with a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 in the
last two full years of university study will be considered for admission to a pre-Master’s program.
These are the minimum requirements of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Units may specify
higher or additional criteria. Admission to a pre-Master’s program does not guarantee future

admission to a Master’s program. As the pre-Master’s program of study is intended to bring a
student’s background up to the equivalent of the required 4-year degree, units should assign to
students, as part of their pre-Master’s program of study, an appropriate number of applicable
upper level (3000 or 4000) undergraduate courses. Courses at the 7000 level or above cannot
be taken in a pre-Master’s program. Courses taken as part of the pre-Master’s program may not
be transferred to a Master’s program at a later date.

3.2 Academic Performance
3.2.1. The unit Head is responsible for assigning the courses and monitoring the progress of
each student.
3.2.2. A minimum degree grade point average of 3.0 with no grade below C+ must be maintained
to continue in a pre-Master’s program. Students who fail to maintain this standing will be required
to withdraw unless remedial action recommended by the unit (as described below) is approved
by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
3.2.3. Students deficient in 6 hours of credit or less may be permitted to write a supplemental
examination (when offered in the unit’s supplemental regulations) in courses in which a grade of
C or less was obtained.
3.2.4. Students deficient in 6 hours of credit or less with a grade of C, D, or F in a course or
courses may be permitted, if the overall average is C or better, to write one supplemental
examination in each course (when offered in the unit’s supplemental regulations), to repeat the
courses, or to take equivalent substitute courses.
Note: In exceptional circumstances, when a student is deficient in more than 6 credit hours, the
student may be permitted to repeat the pre-Master’s year, or to write supplemental examinations
(when offered), or to substitute equivalent coursework in order to make up the deficiencies.
A student may be permitted to repeat the pre-Master’s year only once, and to remove
deficiencies in grades by writing a supplemental examination or repeating courses only once for
each course to a maximum of 9 credit hours of coursework.
If a course is repeated or a supplemental examination is written, the most recent grade obtained
in that course will be used in the determination of the degree GPA.
The degree GPA is cumulative in a pre-Master’s program if more than one year is required to
complete the course requirements.
All action taken administratively is to be reported in summary form to the Faculty of Graduate
Studies Executive Committee.
SECTION 4: General Regulations: Master’s
4.1 General
Although general regulations apply to all students, individual units may have additional
regulations that supplement these general regulations. All such supplemental regulations must be
approved (as specified by the By-Laws of the Faculty of Graduate Studies), be published and
available to students
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/admin/supplemental_regulations.html), and be
kept on record in the Faculty of Graduate Studies. All students should consult unit supplemental
regulations for specific details regarding admission, progression and completion. Individual units

Supplemental Regulation

Permission is granted in the form of a Letter of Permission which may be obtained by making an
application to the Registrar’s Office; an original transcript and course equivalency must be
provided.
4.4.7 Time in Program
The minimum time for students in the Master’s program is equivalent to two terms. Most units
require more than this and students should check unit supplemental regulations regarding
specific requirements.

Note: Maximum time to completion is now 4 years for
full-time students. See section 1.4.1 for criteria relating to
full-time and part-time status.

The maximum time allowed for the completion of the Master’s degree is four years for students
declared as full-time s and six years for students declared as part-time ( see section 1.4.1).
Individual units and/or programs may have specified minimum and maximum time limits, and
students should periodically check unit supplemental regulations regarding these specific
requirements.
Requests for extensions of time to complete the degree will be considered on an individual basis
and must be submitted to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies at least three, but no
more than four, months prior to expiration of the respective maximum time limit.
A student who has not completed the degree requirements within the time limit or within the time
limit of the extension will be required to withdraw from the Faculty of Graduate Studies and the
notation on the student record will be “Required to withdraw”.
4.5 Student’s Advisor/Co-Advisor
Each student should have an advisor upon entry into the program, and must have one assigned
no later than one term following registration. The advisor must:

•
•
•
•

hold at least a Master’s degree or equivalent
be a member of the Faculty of Graduate Studies,
have expertise in a discipline related to the student’s program, and
must hold an appointment in the student's unit.

It is the responsibility of the unit Head to determine whether faculty members meet these criteria,
and also to report to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies on equivalency as necessary.
Any exceptions or special circumstances must be recommended by the unit Head and approved
by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies who considers each case on an individual
basis.
In units where the choice of thesis/practicum topic and thesis/practicum advisor are postponed
after a student’s entry into the program, the unit Head, within one term, shall appoint a faculty
member to advise the student in the interim period before the regular advisor is assigned or
chosen.

Must a student have an advisor identified at time of
admission?
Each student will be assigned a program advisor at the
time of admission in consultation with the MHR Program
Committee. The advisor shall be an MHR professor or
adjunct.
The Program Advisor is a member of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies and is responsible for advising the
student on the program of study and monitoring the
student’s progress, including conducting progress
reviews as required.
The Program Advisor serves as an interim Major
Research Project (or Thesis) Advisor and normally the
Program Advisor becomes the Major Research Project
(or Thesis) Advisor. The Major Research Project (or
Thesis) Advisor is the person primarily responsible for
guiding and supervising the student through the
Program.

In special circumstances, an advisor and co-advisor, upon approval of the unit Head may advise
a student. The co-advisor must meet all of the same qualifications and expectations as the
advisor. Together the advisor/co-advisor shall fulfill the role of advisor. When an advisor and coadvisor are assigned, together they shall fulfill the role of the advisor (that is, neither shall fulfill
any other advisory or examining committee membership requirements for that student). One
advisor must be identified as the primary advisor; however, both co-advisors’ signatures are
required on all documents where the advisor’s signature is required.
The advisor/co-advisor will advise the student on a program of study, direct research, and
supervise the thesis or practicum work.
The advisor and student must discuss, and complete, the Faculty of Graduate Studies Advisor
Student Guidelines (ASG) prior to the commencement of any research and no later than the
submission of the first Progress Report for the student. The advisor and the student are required

to sign the agreement; if the parties cannot agree on any component(s) of the ASG, the matter
should be referred to the unit Graduate Chair, Head of the unit or the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies.
Should, during the student’s program, the relationship between the student and advisor
significantly deteriorate, the matter should be referred to the unit Graduate Chair, the Head of the
unit or to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
All students should consult unit supplemental regulations for specific details regarding
advisor/co-advisor requirements.
4.6 Advisory Committee
4.6.1 Thesis/Practicum Route
Advisory committees are normally selected by the advisor in consultation with the student and
should consist of individuals whose expertise is consistent with that necessary to provide
additional advice to the student during his/her research program. The advisory committee must
consist of a minimum of three members (including the advisor/co-advisor), two of whom must be
members of the Faculty of Graduate Studies, one of whom must hold a primary appointment from
within the unit and one of whom must hold no appointment within the unit. Advisory committees
may include one non-voting guest member who has expertise in a related discipline
but is not a member of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The composition of, and any changes to,
the advisory committee, including the advisor/co-advisor, must be approved by the Faculty of
Graduate Studies. The advisor/co-advisor is the Chair of the advisory committee.

Thesis option: The thesis advisory committee shall
consist of the student’s adviser, a University of Manitoba
faculty member outside the MHR program and either
another MHR professor/adjunct or a qualified person
external to the University of Manitoba (a faculty member
from another university or an academically qualified staff
member of a human rights organization).
Major research project option: The student’s advisor will
consult a second reader following submission of the
paper. The second reader will normally be selected by
the advisor in consultation with the MHR program
director.

Additional specifications regarding the advisory committee are found in the unit supplemental
regulations and students should consult these regulations for specific requirements.
4.6.2 Course-based/Comprehensive Examination Route
Normally, advisory committees are not required in these routes, however any appropriate
specifications regarding an advisory committee can be found in the unit’s supplemental
regulations and students should consult these regulations for specific requirements.
4.6.3 Accredited professional programs
Normally, advisory committees are not required in these routes, however any appropriate
specifications regarding an advisory committee can be found in the unit’s supplemental
regulations and students should consult these regulations for specific requirements.

(analogous to that required by FGS for PhD students) for
internal use

Students are not permitted to change their program of study, including withdrawal from individual
courses, without the approval of their advisor/co-advisor (and/or advisory committee) and unit
Head. Withdrawal from courses or changes of course category without such approval will result
in the student being required to withdraw from the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
4.7.2 Lapse of Credit of Courses

Note: Lapse of course credit is now 7 years.

Courses completed more than seven years prior to the date of awarding of a degree may not
normally be used for credit toward that degree.
4.7.3 Academic Performance

Is a reference to section 2.1 necessary?

Student progress shall be reported at least annually to the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the
“Progress Report” form (http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html).
Students who fail to maintain satisfactory performance may be required to withdraw on the
recommendation of the Graduate Chair/unit Head to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies

Note:
Blue-shaded boxes must be filled in. Yellow-shaded boxes must be filled in if a unit offers that specific program
route (i.e. Comprehensive Examination route)

on the “Progress Report” form. Two consecutive “in need of improvements” normally requires the
student to withdraw.
4.7.4 Performance in Coursework
A minimum degree grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 with no grade below C+ must be maintained
to continue in the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Units may specify, in their supplementary
regulations, standards that are higher than those of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Students
who fail to maintain the specified grades will be required to withdraw unless a unit recommends
remedial action. Any such action must be approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies.
4.7.5 Performance not related to Coursework
In some units, students are required to demonstrate satisfactory academic performance in areas
not related to performance in courses, such as attendance at or participation in course lectures,
seminars and in laboratories and progress in research, thesis or practicum. The specific nature of
satisfactory academic performance is outlined in individual unit supplemental regulations and
students should consult these supplemental regulations for specific requirements. Unacceptable
performance must be reported to the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the “Progress Report Form”
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). Students who fail to maintain
satisfactory performance may be required to withdraw on the recommendation of the unit Head
to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.

A student may not remediate a course in which a grade
lower than a C+ was assigned due to academic
dishonesty. See section 2.3.

Additional examples could include attendance in
seminars, standards of ethical behavior, professional
dress codes, etc.
Mandatory professional seminars (non-credit): These
seminars are intended to provide grounding in the skills
required to undertake human rights work and will include
such topics as non-academic writing (reports, funding
applications, policy briefs, legislation etc.) social media,
cross-cultural communication, budgeting, negotiation,
professional ethics, working with journalists, presentation
skills, grant writing, human rights curation, and career
paths. Tours will also be arranged of local archives and
museums and relevant historical sites.

4.8 Requirements for Graduation
All students must:

•
•
•

maintain a minimum degree grade point average of 3.0 with no grade below C+,
meet the minimum and not exceed the maximum course requirements, and
meet the minimum and not exceed the maximum time requirements.

Individual units may have additional specific requirements for graduation and students should
consult unit supplemental regulations for these specific requirements.
4.8.1 Thesis/Practicum Route
4.8.1.1 Thesis vs. Practicum
Students must demonstrate their mastery of the field and that they are fully conversant with the
relevant literature through their thesis/practicum.
A practicum differs from the thesis in its emphasis on the application of theory, it is however
similar in scope, span, and rigour. The rigour required for the practicum is equal to that required
for the thesis. The practicum takes the form of an exercise in the practical application of
knowledge and skill. It usually involves the careful definition of a problem, the application of
appropriate knowledge and skills to the problem, and a report of the results in a manner suitable
for evaluation by an examining committee. Individual units have specific requirements for
graduation and students should consult unit supplemental regulations for specific requirements.
The thesis is developed under the mentorship of the advisor/co-advisor. Individual units may
have specific guidelines regarding the thesis proposal and its acceptance by the student’s
advisory committee/unit Head; students should consult unit supplemental regulations for specific
requirements. Research must be approved by the appropriate Human Research Ethics Board or
Animal Care Committee, if applicable, before the work has begun on the thesis research.

Thesis/Practicum Proposal:
Provide details of proposal format, page limits, other
guidelines, evaluation procedures, who approves the
proposal; at what point in the program is the thesis
proposal to be completed; is the oral presentation
completed in open or closed session; is unanimous
approval required; can a thesis proposal that is not
approved the first time be resubmitted, etc.
Thesis Proposal
Students must complete a thesis proposal. The proposal
may be submitted after the student has completed 9
credit hours of coursework. Students should normally
submit their thesis proposals within three months of
completing their coursework to maintain momentum,
structure, continuity and connection with the program
and faculty.
Under the supervision of the Thesis Advisor, the student
must prepare a 10-15 page written thesis proposal that is
submitted to the Thesis Advisory Committee. The
student is required to defend the thesis proposal orally in
open session. The proposal will outline in some detail
the problem the student intends to investigate.

Note:
Blue-shaded boxes must be filled in. Yellow-shaded boxes must be filled in if a unit offers that specific program

It should include an introduction, a context section,
the theoretical background of the study, the
methodology to be used, the research questions, and
the significance of the study.
The Thesis Advisor will call a Thesis Advisory Committee
meeting to consider the adequacy of the proposal. The
Advisor must provide written notices to each member of
the Thesis Advisory Committee advising them of the oral
defence date. Students must submit the written proposal
to each member of the Thesis Advisory Committee at
least two weeks prior to the meeting. Students should
normally defend their thesis proposals within six months
of completing their coursework to maintain momentum,
structure, continuity and connection with the program
and faculty. The student will formally present the
proposal in a forum open to all faculty members and
graduate students of the Program.
The purposes of the proposal examination meeting are:
1) to enable the Thesis Advisory Committee to assess
the student’s preparation for undertaking independent
graduate research;
2) to consider the feasibility of the proposed research;
and
3) to provide necessary feedback for further
advancement of the research.
The Thesis Advisor shall chair the thesis proposal
defence. All members of the Thesis Advisory Committee
shall be present at the proposal defence unless
specifically exempted by the Chair of the MHR Program
Committee. The student and committee members must
be present in person or via video- or tele-conference.
The proposal meeting will be chaired by the Advisor, and
will have the following steps:
1) introduction by the Advisor;
2) presentation of highlights of the research proposal
by the student;
3) review of the proposal by the Thesis Advisory
Committee and oral defence by the student;
4) evaluation of the proposal by the Thesis Advisory
Committee on a pass/fail basis.
For a successful oral defence, the decision of the Thesis
Advisory Committee must be by majority. Unanimity is
not required. Students whose proposals pass with
revisions must complete the revisions under the
supervision of the Thesis Advisor. The feedback received
must be incorporated into the document. Unsuccessful
candidates will be allowed a second attempt within 2
months of the first attempt.

Following the successful defence of the thesis proposal,
the Thesis Advisor should work with the student and the
Thesis Advisory Committee to address any concerns
raised in the proposal meeting.
After successful defence of the thesis proposal, the
student may proceed to the stage of research and thesis
writing. See the Thesis Guidelines on the Faculty of
Graduate Studies website
http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/thesis/25
0.html
Where the research involves human subjects, data
collection shall not proceed until the thesis proposal has
been approved and until approval has been secured
from the relevant University of Manitoba Research Ethics
Board.
If a candidate fails a Thesis proposal on two occasions
he/she will be required to withdraw from the program.
Thesis
The MHR thesis is an independently written research
document on a topic of relevance to human rights. The
thesis would normally range from 80 to 100 pages of
double-spaced typescript, including notes and
bibliography. The thesis should demonstrate that the
student has mastery of the specific field of human rights
research under investigation, and is fully conversant with
the relevant literature. The thesis should also
demonstrate that the candidate has made a contribution
to knowledge in the field of human rights research.
The thesis may entail co-operation with other faculties at
the University of Manitoba, and agencies in the local and
wider global community. In general, the overall goal of the
thesis is to build or apply theory through disciplined and
focused independent study. Consequently, the
thesis should be based on scholarly study and research
that encompasses both theoretical and empirical aspects
of human rights research.
Practicum
The student, under the supervision of a site supervisor,
will accrue at least 300 hours at a practicum site, usually
during the summer. Students will meet with the course
instructor on a regular basis to discuss related topics,
experiences and to problem-solve issues that may arise
in the sites. Students are responsible for maintaining a
Log of Practicum Hours and Project Notes. This log is to
be signed by the site supervisor and submitted at the
end of the semester to the faculty member teaching the
practicum course and supervising the practicum.
The Practicum Agencies that participate in the practicum
course will be selected because of the potential
opportunities for student learning, unique program focus,
and direct application of human rights skills and
knowledge. Every agency must have staff members who
apply human rights analysis in their professional work.
Students will be asked to make a specific positive
contribution to the operation of their host organizations in

the form of a report, curriculum module, work of art,
documentary film, workshop, website, strategic plan, or
other such project. Prior to the start of this field
experience, students will spend two to three weeks
orienting themselves regarding the organization. The
final phase involves writing a reflective paper of
approximately 4,000 words.
Major Research Project (following the practicum) The
Major Research Project in Human Rights is primary
research on a human rights topic that leads to an original
7,500 to 10,000 word paper that could be submitted for
academic or professional journal publication. Students
will select an advisor in consultation with the MHR
director and develop a topic, in many cases inspired by
their practicum experience. The resulting paper will be
reviewed by the advisor and a second reader, who will
offer constructive criticism. The student will then present
his or her revised research results at a student-led
symposium dedicated to this purpose, after which a
passing or failing grade will be assigned by the advisor.

4.8.1.2 Examining Committee

Specify how the examining committee differs from the
advisory committee

The advisor will recommend an examining committee to the unit Head for approval, which shall
then be reported to the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the “Master’s Thesis/Practicum Title and
Appointment of Examiners” form
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). This form must be approved by
the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies prior to the distribution of the thesis
Under normal circumstances, the examining committee will be the same as the advisory
committee unless otherwise stipulated in the unit’s Supplemental regulations. The examining
committee must consist of a minimum of three members (including the advisor), two of whom
must be members of the Faculty of Graduate Studies, one of whom must hold a primary
appointment from within the unit and one of whom must hold no appointment within the unit. All
examiners must be deemed qualified by the unit Head and be willing to serve. The composition of,
and any changes to, the examining committee, including the advisor/co-advisor, must be
approved by the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Individual units require specific requirements for
examination and students should consult unit supplemental regulations for specific requirements.

Thesis stream:
Normally the Thesis Advisory Committee serves as the
Thesis Examining Committee. The Thesis Advisory
Committee must consist of a minimum of three persons
(see 4.6.1).
Practicum stream:
The instructor teaching the course evaluates the
practicum and the student’s advisor evaluates the major
research project.

The Head of the unit arranges for the distribution of the thesis/practicum to the examiners. It is
the duty of all examiners to read the thesis/practicum and report on its merits according to the
following categories:

•
•
•

Acceptable, without modification or with minor revision(s); or
Acceptable, subject to modification and/or revision(s); or
Not acceptable.

4.8.1.3 Oral Examination
For units requiring students to pass an oral examination on the subject of the thesis/practicum and
matters relating thereto, the format of the oral examination is described in the supplementary
regulations of the unit. Students should consult these supplemental regulations for specific
requirements. A student has the right to an examination of the thesis/practicum if he/she believes
it is ready for examination. It is the unit’s responsibility to warn the student of any risk involved
should he/she decide to proceed against the unit’s recommendation.
All members of the examining committee should be present at the examination.

Note: There is provision for a dissenting voice in the
outcome of the evaluation of the oral examination and
written thesis.
Provide details of scheduling of the oral examination,
format and procedures of the examination, time
constraints on oral presentation, duration of questioning
by examiners, number of rounds of questions, etc.
The examination of the thesis and its subsequent oral
defence is carried out according to the regulations of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies. When the thesis has been

Supplemental Regulation

The oral examination shall be open to all members of The University of Manitoba community
except in exceptional cases. The oral examination may be closed, for example, when the results
of the thesis/practicum research must be kept confidential for a period of time. In such cases, the
examining committee and unit Head shall recommend such action to the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies who shall then approve that the final examination be closed to all but the
examining committee and the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Following completion of the examination of the thesis/practicum, examiners will consider the oral
examination and the written thesis/practicum.
The examiners will also determine the nature of and procedures for approval of any revisions
that will be required prior to submission of the thesis to the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The
advisor is normally responsible for ensuring that revisions are completed according to the
instructions from the examining committee.
The judgement of the examiners shall be reported to the Faculty of Graduate Studies in the
qualitative terms “approved” or “not approved” on the thesis/practicum final report form
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). Each examiner must indicate
his/her opinion by his/her signature. If two or more examiners do not approve the thesis, then the
student is deemed to have failed the defence.
The examining committee may recommend to the Faculty of Graduate Studies that the thesis is
of sufficient merit to receive an award.

4.8.1.4 Failure
In the case of a failure of the thesis/practicum at the Master’s level, a detailed written report will be
prepared by the Chair of the examination committee and submitted to the Faculty of Graduate
Studies, who will make the report available to the student and advisor/co-advisor.
A student will be required to withdraw when the thesis/practicum has been rejected twice at the
stage where:

•
•
•

developed to the point where the student, the other
members of the Examining Committee, and the Advisor
are satisfied that it is ready to be examined, the Thesis
Advisor will submit a written statement to this effect to
the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
The Thesis will follow the procedures as outlined by the
Faculty of Graduate Studies. The oral defence of the
thesis is open to all members of the University of
Manitoba community.
The final examination for the MHR thesis proceeds in
two stages: a) the student will first present a summary
(10-15 minutes) of the research contribution; and b) the
examination of the candidate’s thesis.
Typically there are 2 rounds of questioning permitted; the
first of 10 minutes for each examiner, and the second of
5 minutes for each examiner.
The examination portion should not exceed 70 minutes.
The Examining Committee will meet in private to
determine if the thesis and defence is acceptable without
modification, acceptable with minor revisions, acceptable
with major revisions, or not acceptable. Members of the
Examining Committee may require that they review
revisions to the thesis or may decide to have the Advisor
supervise the revisions. The Examining Committee’s
decision is then announced to the candidate. A thesis may
not be formally submitted for examination more than
twice.
The report from the Chair should include how the first
failure will be addressed and a timeline for when the
second attempt should occur.
The Advisor and the Thesis Examining Committee will
work closely with the student on the thesis to address all
of the committee’s concerns. A second attempt shall be
allowed within six months of the first attempt.
If a candidate fails a Thesis defence on two occasions
he/she will be required to withdraw from the program.

The examining committee reports on the merits of the written thesis;
The defence; or
A combination of both stages.

The examining process should be completed within one month of distribution of the
thesis/practicum.

For those programs that do not have a culminating exercise (thesis/practicum/comprehensive
examination/M.Eng. project/Design thesis) the unit must forward potential graduate names to the
Faculty of Graduate Studies by the deadline. The deadline for each of the graduation dates is
published in the Academic Schedule of the Academic Graduate Calendar.
4.11 Details for Submissions of the Final Copy
Following the approval of the thesis/practicum by the examining committee and the completion of
any revisions required by that committee, the thesis/practicum, must be submitted to the Faculty of
Graduate Studies as follows:

•
•

One digital version submitted as an e-thesis/practicum at the MSpace website
(https://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/index.jsp)
Final approval and release forms.

4.12 Publication and Circulation of Thesis/Practicum
Every graduate student registering in a thesis/practicum Master’s program at The University of
Manitoba shall be advised that, as a condition of being awarded the degree, he/she will be
required to grant a license of partial copyright to the University and to the Library and Archives
Canada for any thesis or practicum submitted as part of their degree program.
Note: This license makes the thesis/practicum available for further research only. Publication for
commercial purposes remains the sole right of the author.
The forms and conditions pertaining to these license agreements are available with the Faculty of
Graduate Studies. This and other related regulations may give rise to important questions of law,
and students may need additional legal advice on the copyright laws of Canada and/or other
countries. Students who wish to obtain legal advice concerning their subsequent rights are
advised to do so prior to signing the agreements. Signing of the license agreements is normally
done after the contents of the thesis/practicum have been delineated and the importance of
copyright and/or patents fully comprehended.

One digital version of the approved thesis must be
submitted as an e-thesis at the MSpace
website: https://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/index.jsp
The e-thesis is the official copy. Students are encouraged
to review the e-thesis submission requirements prior to
creating a digital version. Electronic multimedia files or
accompanying files that are part of an e-thesis should be
posted to MSpace as separate files. Students are
encouraged to provide each committee member with a
bound copy of the thesis.

Publication in the above manner does not preclude further publication of the thesis or practicum
report or any part of it in a journal or in a book. In such cases, an acknowledgement that the work
was originally part of a thesis/practicum at The University of Manitoba should be included.
Notes:
Patents –Refer to section 6 “Policy of Withholding Theses Pending Patent Applications” in this
Guide.
Restriction of Theses/Practica for Publication – In exceptional cases, not covered by the

practicum to The University of Manitoba. The Dean shall determine for what period, if any,
access will be so restricted.
Library and Archives Canada – Library and Archives Canada obtains a copy of the thesis via
the University’s MSpace repository.
SECTION 5: Doctor of Philosophy General Regulations
The degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) is granted only upon evidence of general proficiency
and of distinctive attainment in a special field. In particular, the candidate must demonstrate an
ability for independent investigation, original research or creative scholarship. This is expected to
be presented in a thesis with a degree of literary skill and by an oral examination wherein the
candidate exhibits mastery of their field. The Ph.D. is a research degree and is not conferred by
the University of Manitoba solely as a result of coursework study.

There is no Ph.D. offered in MHR.

Although general regulations apply to all students, individual units may have additional
regulations that supplement these general regulations. All such supplemental regulations must be
approved (as specified by the By-Laws of the Faculty of Graduate Studies), be published and
available to students
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/admin/supplemental_regulations.html), and be
kept on record in the Faculty of Graduate Studies. All students should consult unit supplemental
regulations for specific details regarding admission, progression and completion.
5.1 Admission
5.1.1 General criteria
Normally, the completion of a Master’s degree or equivalent from a recognized university and a
cumulative GPA of 3.0 or equivalent in the last two previous years of full time university study (60
credit hours) is the minimum requirement for admission to the Ph.D. program. However, the
criteria for admissions into the Ph.D. program are more stringent than for Masters’ programs;
therefore, the completion of a Master’s program does not guarantee admission into the Ph.D.
program. Some units require completion of a thesis-based Master’s program prior to admission to
a Ph.D. program.
5.1.2 Direct Admission from the Bachelor’s Honours or equivalent
With special recommendation of the unit concerned, applicants with an honours Bachelor’s
degree or equivalent may be considered for entry to Ph.D. study. These students must be
outstanding in their academic background (GPA well above 3.0 in the last two full years of
undergraduate study). Once admitted, these students must complete at least 24 credit hours of
coursework, unless the individual unit’s approved supplemental regulations specify otherwise,
and will be assessed Ph.D. fees for 3 years.
5.1.3 Transfer from the Master’s to the Ph.D. program
Students who have not completed a Master’s program may transfer to the Ph.D. program within
the same unit upon the recommendation by the Head of the unit to the Faculty of Graduate
Studies. The recommendation should be made within 18 months of the student’s
commencement of the Master’s program. The coursework completed and time spent in the
Master’s program will normally be credited towards the Ph.D. program. Students must complete
at least 24 credit hours of coursework, unless the individual unit’s approved Supplemental
regulations specify otherwise.
The request to transfer from a Master’s to the Ph.D. program must be submitted to the Faculty of
Graduate Studies at least one month prior to the term for which the student intends to commence
the Ph.D. program. The following are required when making the request: The “Application for
Admission” form (and application fee); “Ph.D. Selection Committee Report” form
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/media/cte_selection_report.pdf); and in the case
where the student does not hold a Master’s degree, a letter of recommendation from the Head of

the unit.
If the transfer occurs within 12 months of the initial registration in the Master’s program, the
student will be assessed Ph.D. fees for 3 years. If the transfer occurs after 12 months, the
student will be assessed Ph.D. program fees for 2 years (as they will have already paid fees for
the Master’s program). Students are cautioned that such transfers may impact on the University
of Manitoba Graduate Fellowship duration.
Where a student with a Master’s degree or equivalent is initially admitted and registered in a
Master’s program, that student may be transferred to the Ph.D. program within the same unit on
the recommendation of the student’s advisor/co-advisor and Head of the unit, provided that
follow up transfer recommendation occurs within 12 months of the initial registration in the
Master’s program. In such a case, the application fee is waived and fees assessed towards the
Master’s program will be deducted from the full 2 years of Ph.D. program fees. Transfers later
than 12 months must pay an application fee and their fees will be assessed as a 3 year Ph.D.
5.1.4 Provisional Admission to the Ph.D.
Students nearing the completion of the Master’s degree may be accepted provisionally to the
Ph.D. program for a 12 month period (commencing with the first registration in the Ph.D.
program). Further registration in the Ph.D. program is contingent upon completion of all
requirements of the Master’s degree within the 12 months. Students must maintain continuous
registration in their Master’s program until its completion. Students will require assistance from
the unit and the Faculty of Graduate Studies to complete dual registration in the Master’s and
Ph.D. program simultaneously.
5.1.5 English Language Proficiency
Applicants whose first language is not English and who have not resided in a designated Englishspeaking country for three years immediately prior to application must provide proof of English
language proficiency. Normally, this is done by providing results directly to the Faculty of
Graduate Studies from one of the following recognised English language competency tests:

•
•
•
•
•
•

MELAB – Minimum Final score of 80
TOEFL – Minimum iBT score of 80, or a minimum PBT 550
canTEST – Minimum band of 4.5 in Listening and Reading, and a band of 4.0 in
Writing
IELTS – Minimum score of 6.5 on the Academic Module
CAEL – Minimum 60 overall and 60 on each subject
AEPUCE – Minimum 65% overall.

The language competency test may be waived if the applicant has completed a degree at a
recognised University where the language of instruction is English. Some units specify an
additional language requirement for the Ph.D. degree. Students should check unit supplemental
regulations regarding this requirement.
In all cases, test scores older than two years are invalid.
5.1.6 Students with Disabilities
See Accommodation Policy for Students with Disabilities:
http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/students/281.html
5.2 Student Advisor, Co-advisor and Advisory Committee
5.2.1 Student Advisor
Every Ph.D. student must have an advisor, appointed by the Head of the unit. The advisor is
responsible for supervising the student’s graduate program. The advisor is the student’s first

point of contact at the University of Manitoba, and therefore should be familiar with the general
policies and regulations of the Faculty of Graduate Studies as well as the specific supplementary
regulations of their academic unit. The advisor is directly responsible for the supervision of the
student's graduate program. In this capacity, the advisor assists the student in planning the
graduate program, and ensures that the student is aware of all graduate program requirements,
degree regulations, and general regulations of the academic unit, the Faculty of Graduate
Studies, the university, and external funding agencies. The academic advisor provides counsel for
all aspects of the graduate program, and stays informed of the student's scholarly activities and
progress. The student’s advisor also acts as a channel of communication to the student’s
advisory committee, the unit and the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
The advisor must:

•
•
•
•
•

be a member of the Faculty of Graduate Studies,
hold a Ph.D. or equivalent*,
be active in research,
have expertise in a discipline related to the student’s program, and
hold an appointment in the student's unit

*Equivalency will be approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and determined
on a case by case basis and assessed by the potential advisor’s demonstrated research record
and current research activities. Note that M.D., D.M.D. and J.D. are undergraduate degrees and
are not considered per se to be equivalent to a Ph.D.
Usually the student and the advisor choose to work together by mutual agreement. In units
where the choice of thesis topic advisor is postponed for some time after entry into the program,
the Head of the unit or the selection committee shall appoint a faculty member to advise the
student as to the rules and regulations and on a program and course requirements. This interim
period must not exceed eighteen months after entry in to the program before a permanent
advisor is chosen.
The advisor and student must discuss, and complete, the Faculty of Graduate Studies Advisor
Student Guidelines (ASG) prior to the commencement of any research and no later than the
submission of the first Progress Report for the student. The advisor and the student are required
to sign the agreement; if the parties cannot agree on any component(s) of the ASG, the matter
should be referred to the unit Graduate Chair, the Head of the unit or the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies.
Should, during the student’s program, the relationship between the student and advisor
significantly deteriorate, the matter should be referred to the unit Graduate Chair, the Head of
the unit or to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.2.2 Co-advisor
In special circumstances, upon approval of the Head of the unit, an advisor and co-advisor may
advise a student.
The co-advisor must:

•
•
•
•

be a member of the Faculty of Graduate Studies,
hold a Ph.D. or equivalent*,
be active in research, and
have expertise in a discipline related to the student's program

*Equivalency will be approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies, determined on a

case by case basis and assessed by the potential co-advisor’s demonstrated research record
and current research activities. Note that M.D., D.M.D. and J.D. are undergraduate degrees and
are not considered per se to be equivalent to a Ph.D.
The co-advisor will usually be identified either:
A) at the beginning of a student’s program in situations where:
1 .the student desires to draw equally upon the expertise of two individuals, or
2. the project is interdisciplinary in nature and requires the expertise of two advisors from
their respective disciplines, or
B) mid-way through a student’s program due to:
1.
2.

the student's project developing in such a way as he/she requiring an additional
advisor from a different discipline, or
the unit introducing a new Faculty member, to the standards of the unit, whose
expertise facilitates the student's project.

When an advisor and co-advisor are assigned, together they shall fulfill the role of the advisor
(that is, neither shall fulfill any other advisory or examining committee membership requirements
for that student). One advisor must be identified as the primary advisor; however, both the
advisor and co-advisor’s signatures are required on all documents where the advisor’s signature
is required.
In all instances the Faculty of Graduate Studies must be informed of the co-assignment.
5.2.3 Advisory Committee
The Head of the unit is responsible for the establishment of an advisory committee for each Ph.D.
student. Advisory committees are normally selected by the advisor/co-advisor in consultation
with the student and should consist of individuals whose expertise is consistent with that
necessary to provide additional advice to the student during his/her program. The advisory
committee must consist of a minimum of three members of the Faculty of Graduate Studies, one
of whom must hold a primary appointment from within the unit and one of whom must hold no
appointment within the unit. Advisory committees may include one non-voting guest member
who has expertise in a related discipline but is not a member of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
The composition of, and any changes to, the advisory committee, including the advisor/coadvisor, must be approved by the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The advisor/co-advisor is the
Chair of the advisory committee. Advisory committee meetings which must be held at least
annually are not intended to take the place of meetings between the student and advisor, which
should occur with much greater frequency than the advisory committee meetings.
5.3 Program of Study
As soon as possible, but no later than 24 months after a student has commenced their program,
the student’s program of study should be registered with the Faculty of Graduate Studies and
should include:

•
•
•
•

information about the minimum or expected time for completion of the degree;
coursework to be taken;
any foreign language requirement;
the research area in which the thesis will be written.

The approval of the student’s advisor/co-advisor and the Head of the unit are sufficient for
registration. The program of study, including withdrawal from individual courses and any
subsequent changes, must be approved by the student’s advisor/co-advisor, the advisory

committee and the Head of the unit. Withdrawal from courses or changes of course category
without such approval may result in the student being required to withdraw from the Faculty of
Graduate Studies.
5.4 Program Requirements
All students must complete one of the following programs of study for the Ph.D. degree, unless
otherwise specified in the approved unit supplemental regulations:

•

•

Where admission to the Ph.D. is directly from a Master’s degree, a minimum of 12
credit hours at the 7000 level or higher plus a thesis is required. Any further
coursework beyond the minimum 12 credit hours at the 7000 level must be at the 3000
level or above. For those students who hold a Master’s degree, a maximum of 24
credit hours of coursework is allowed toward the Ph.D. program.*
Where admission to the Ph.D. is directly from an Honours Bachelor degree or
equivalent, a minimum of 24 credit hours plus a thesis is required. The coursework
must include a minimum of 18 credit hours at the 7000 level or higher with the balance
of the coursework at the 3000 level or higher. For those students who do not hold a
Master’s degree, a maximum of 48 credit hours of coursework is allowed toward the
Ph.D. program.*

*Unless professional accreditation requirements and/or supplemental regulations indicate
otherwise.
5.4.1 Language Reading Requirements
Some units specify a language requirement for the Ph.D. degree. Students are advised to check
unit Supplemental regulations regarding this requirement.
5.4.2 Advance Credit
Advance credit for courses completed prior to admission to a Ph.D. program will be considered
on an individual basis. The student’s unit makes the request to the Faculty of Graduate Studies
by completion of the “Recommendation for Advance Credit (Transfer of Courses)” form.
1. Application for advance credit must be made within the first year of the program (see Lapse of
Credit of Courses in this section).
2. No more than half of the required coursework for the program can be given advance credit.
3. A course may not be used for credit toward more than one degree, diploma or certificate.
4. The student must register at The University of Manitoba for one academic year as a full-time
student and must also complete the thesis at The University of Manitoba.
5. Regardless of the extent of advanced credit received, all students are required to pay the
program fee.
5.4.3 Transfer Credit
Courses within a program of study may be taken elsewhere and transferred for credit at The
University of Manitoba. All such courses:
1.
2.
3.
4.

must be approved for transfer to the program of study by the unit and the Faculty of
Graduate Studies before the student may register for them;
are considered on an individual basis;
cannot be used for credit towards another degree ;
may be taken at other universities while registered in a program at The University of
Manitoba, provided that the credit does not exceed 50% of the minimum credit hours

of coursework required.
Permission is granted in the form of a Letter of Permission which may be obtained by making an
application to the Registrar’s Office; an original transcript and course equivalency must be
provided.
5.4.4 Lapse of Credit of Courses
Courses completed more than seven years prior to the date of awarding of a degree may not
normally be used for credit toward that degree.
5.5 Time Limits
5.5.1 Minimum Time Limit
The minimum time requirement for the program of study for a Ph.D. degree will normally be two
years of study beyond the level of the Master’s degree, or three years beyond the level of a
Bachelor’s degree. The student may be permitted to spend one of these years in an approved
program of research or study elsewhere. Such permission must be approved by the Dean of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies on the recommendation of the student’s advisory committee.
5.5.2 Maximum Time Limit
A student’s candidature shall lapse if he/she fails to complete the degree within six years
following initial registration in the Ph.D. program. For those students who transfer from the
Master’s to the Ph.D., years spent in the Master’s program are counted as years in the Ph.D.
program. Recommendations for extensions of time to complete the degree will be considered on
an individual basis and must be approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
A student who has not completed the degree requirements within the time limit or within the time
limit of any extension that has been granted (see also sections “Extension of Time to Complete
Program of Study” and “Leave of Absence”) will be required to withdraw from the Faculty of
Graduate Studies and the notation on the student record will be “Required to withdraw”.
5.6 Academic Performance
Student progress shall be reported at least annually to the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the
“Progress Report” form (http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html).
Students who fail to maintain satisfactory performance may be required to withdraw on the
recommendation of the Graduate Chair/unit Head to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies
on the “Progress Report” form. Two consecutive “in need of improvements” normally requires the
student to withdraw.
5.6.1 Performance in Coursework
A minimum degree grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 with no grade below C+ must be maintained
to continue in the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Units may specify, in their supplementary
regulations, standards that are higher than those of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Students
who fail to maintain the specified grades will be required to withdraw unless a unit recommends
remedial action. Any such action must be approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies.
5.6.2 Performance Not Related to Coursework
Students may be required to withdraw from their Ph.D. program for reasons of unsatisfactory
performance other than those related to failing grades. These include, but are not restricted to,
unsatisfactory attendance and lack of progress in research and/or thesis preparation. The
student’s advisory committee will make a recommendation for required withdrawal to the Head of
the unit. The Head of the unit may then recommend to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies that the student be required to withdraw for reasons of unsatisfactory academic
performance.
5.7 Academic Requirement for Graduation

Note:

route (i.e. Comprehensive Examination route)

127

FGS Template updated August 2014

Faculty of Graduate Studies Regulation

Supplemental Regulation

A cumulative degree grade point average of 3.0 or greater is required in those courses that
constitute the program of study for graduation in the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.8 Candidacy Examination
The candidacy examination is an absolute requirement of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and,
as such, cannot be waived under any circumstances. However, the format and content of the
candidacy exam will vary from unit to unit. The purposes of the candidacy exam in doctoral
programs is to determine the student's competence in the discipline with respect to
understanding and absorbing a broad spectrum of material, and then researching, identifying,
analysing, synthesizing, and communicating ideas about that material in depth.
At the time specified by the advisory committee--normally within the first year after the
completion of the Ph.D. program coursework but in no case later than one year prior to
expected graduation--the student must successfully complete the formal candidacy
examination.
The examination is conducted according to a procedure established by the unit and approved by
the Academic Guide Committee of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Please see the unit
supplemental regulations for the format and composition of the examination committee for the
candidacy examination. The Candidacy Examination must be held at the University of Manitoba.
This examination, which is independent from the thesis Proposal, may be oral, written, or
both and may cover subjects relevant to the general area of the candidate's research. These
must be made known to the students.
A pass decision of the examiners must be unanimous. Students must be provided with feedback
on their performance and access to the reasons for the pass/fail.
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies must be informed whether the candidate has
passed or failed the candidacy examination on the “Report on Ph.D. Candidacy Examination”
form (http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html).
Any student who fails the candidacy examination twice will be required to withdraw from the
Faculty of Graduate Studies.
On successful completion of this examination, the student will be considered a candidate for the
Ph.D. degree.
5.9 Thesis Proposal
Some units have specific procedures in place for approval of thesis proposals and students are
advised to refer to the specific unit supplemental regulations. If units require thesis Proposal
approval, this exercise is independent from the candidacy examination. Regardless, the
proposed thesis research must be approved by the advisory committee and, if necessary, by the
Human Research Ethics Board or Animal Care Committee before the work has begun on the
thesis research or project.
5.10 Thesis
An essential feature of Ph.D. study is the candidate’s demonstration of competence to complete
a research project and present the findings. The thesis must constitute a distinct contribution to
knowledge in the major field of study, and the research must be of sufficient merit to be, in the
judgement of the examiners, acceptable for publication.
The thesis must be written according to a standard style acknowledged within the candidate’s
particular field of study and recommended by the unit, be lucid and well written, and be
reasonably free from errors of style and grammar (including typographical errors).

The final version of the thesis must be submitted by the candidate to the Faculty of Graduate
Studies following the guidelines found at:
http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/thesis/guidelines.html
5.11 Thesis Examination Procedures
The final examination for the Ph.D. degree proceeds in three stages (see Figure 5-1):
1.
2.
3.

Examination of the candidate’s thesis by an internal examining committee.
Examination of the candidate’s thesis by an external examiner.
Oral examination of the candidate by all examiners on the subject of the thesis and
any matters relating thereto.

5.11.1 Formation of the Examining Committee I - University of Manitoba (Internal)
Examiners
The candidate’s advisor (and, if appropriate, co-advisor) is considered to be a voting member of
the examining committee. The candidate’s advisor (and, if appropriate, co-advisor) is considered
to be a voting member of the examining committee. The candidate’s advisor/co-advisor, in
consultation with the Head of the unit, will recommend at least three internal thesis examiners to
the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies for approval via the Thesis Submission Portal on
JUMP. One member must hold a primary appointment within the unit and one member must hold
no appointment within the unit. All internal examiners must be members of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies. Under normal circumstances these will be members of the candidate’s advisory
committee, if not, approval must be obtained from the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.11.2 Formation of the Examining Committee II - External Examiner
The candidate’s advisor/co-advisor, in consultation with the advisory committee, will recommend
the names of three distinguished scholars from outside the University of Manitoba with particular
experience in the field of the thesis research and Ph.D. student advisory/examination experience
to serve as the external examiner to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies for approval via
the Thesis Submission Portal on JUMP. The recommendations should, if possible, include a
brief CV of each of the prospective external examiners and a short statement detailing the
rationale behind the recommendations, the prospective external examiners’ qualifications,
including a current list of his/her scholarly publications and research activities and, importantly,
their experience with graduate student education. No contact should be made with any of the
prospective external examiners. If any of the recommended examiners does not meet the
following criteria, specified below, a detailed explanation should be included with the rationale for
the recommendation.
The external examiner should:

•
•
•
•

hold a Ph.D. or equivalent;
hold the rank of Associate Professor, Full Professor, Senior Scholar or Emeritus
Professor (or the equivalent if outside North America) at a university, or have
comparable expertise and standing if not a faculty member at a university ;
have an established reputation in the area of the thesis research and be able to
judge whether the thesis would be acceptable at an institution comparable to the
University of Manitoba; and
have significant recent experience with the supervision and/or examination of
Ph.D. students.

The external examiner should not:

•
•

have acted as an external examiner for the same Ph.D. supervisor within the previous
two years;
have been associated with the candidate at any time or in any significant way in the

past five years, present or reasonably foreseeable future (advisor/co-advisor,
colleague, teacher, co-author of published material, family member etc.); or
be associated with the candidate’s advisor/co-advisor in any of the following ways:
former student;
research advisor/co-advisor;
research collaborator within the last five years;
co-author of published material within the last five years.
o have had a significant academic disagreement with the candidate, the
advisor/co-advisor or any member of the advisory committee.

The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will choose the external examiner from the list
provided by the candidate’s advisor/co-advisor and will make the formal invitation to the external
examiner. The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies shall ensure the anonymity of the
external examiner until it has been determined that the student can proceed to oral defence.
5.11.3 Changes in the Examining Committee
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies must approve changes in the membership of the
examining committee. No changes shall be made in the examining committee after the thesis is
submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Should the thesis not be submitted for examination
within 12 months after the appointment of the examining committee, the committee appointment
will lapse and the process shall revert to 5.11.1 above.
5.11.4 Distribution of the Thesis for Examination
It is the responsibility of the Faculty of Graduate Studies to distribute the electronic version of the
thesis to all examiners. The Faculty of Graduate Studies shall attempt to ensure that the thesis is
distributed to examiners as soon as possible after the submission of all required documentation.
The Academic Schedule in the Graduate Calendar should be consulted regarding dates by which
theses must be submitted.
Once the thesis has been submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies, neither the candidate
nor the advisor/co-advisor shall have any communication with the examining committee
regarding the thesis. However should the need arise, the external examiner may contact the
Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies to discuss any issues related to the thesis.
5.11.5 Responsibilities of the Examiners
In general the examiners are responsible for:

•
•
•
•

ensuring that the thesis and the candidate meet recognised scholarly standards for a
Ph.D.
appraising the underlying assumptions, methodology, findings, and scholarly
significance of the findings of the thesis
ensuring that the thesis is organized, presents data and uses accepted conventions for
addressing the scholarly literature in an acceptable manner
evaluating that the candidate has the ability to present their findings orally and
demonstrate their scholarship by responding to questions and defending the thesis

Notes:
1. Any potential breach of academic integrity should be reported to the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies for investigation by the Vice President (Research and International).
2. Submission of previously published, peer-reviewed material in the thesis does not preclude its
examination, either as a written document being reviewed by examiners or at the thesis defence.

Internal Examiners
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will request the internal examiners to give, within
three (3) weeks of the distribution of the thesis, a detailed written report of the thesis and place it
into one of the following categories:
1.

2.

3.

4.

The thesis represents a distinct contribution to the candidate’s field of research and is
acceptable as it stands. Minor revisions to content, structure, or writing style may be
required. The thesis may proceed to external distribution.
The thesis has merit and makes a contribution to the candidate’s field; however, there
are research-related concerns that have the potential to be addressed in the oral
examination. The structure and writing style are acceptable or require only minor
revisions. The thesis may proceed to external distribution.
The thesis has some merit, but is not acceptable in its current state and requires major
revisions to one or more of its core components, such as research content, structure or
writing style. The thesis cannot proceed to external distribution.
The thesis is unacceptable with respect to its core components, such as research
content, structure, and writing style. The thesis cannot proceed to external distribution.

If none or one (the dissenting voice) of the internal examiners fails the thesis (i.e. places it
in categories 3 or 4 above), the thesis receives an internal pass and shall proceed to
external distribution. The candidate’s advisor (and, if appropriate, co-advisor) may also
wish to submit a report. The candidate’s advisor (and, if appropriate, co-advisor) may also
wish to submit a report. Prior to external distribution, the candidate shall have the
opportunity to incorporate changes suggested by the examining committee but not
necessarily those of the dissenting voice. It is the responsibility of the advisor/student to
provide a copy of the revised thesis to all internal committee members prior to the oral
defence.
If two or more of the internal examining committee fail the thesis (i.e. places the thesis in
categories 3 or 4 above) then the thesis fails.
If the thesis fails, the unit Head shall convene a meeting of the internal examining committee and
the candidate’s advisor/co-advisor to decide how to bring the thesis to an acceptable scholarly
standard for a second submission to the internal examining committee. In normal circumstances,
this will involve additional scholarly work which the unit Head will describe, in writing, to the
advisor/co-advisor, the candidate and the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
If more than one of the internal examining committee members fail the resubmitted thesis, this
constitutes a second failure. In the case of a second failure, the candidate cannot proceed to
external distribution, and the candidate is required to withdraw from the Faculty of Graduate
Studies.
The awarding of a passing grade by an individual internal examiner does not preclude them from
awarding a failing grade at a subsequent stage in the examination process.
External Examiner
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will request the external examiner to give, within
three (3) weeks of the distribution of the thesis, a detailed written report of the thesis and rate it
either as a pass or a fail. The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies shall ensure the
anonymity of the external examiner until it has been determined that the student can proceed to
oral defence.

The awarding of a passing grade by an external examiner does not preclude them from awarding
a failing grade at a subsequent stage in the examination process.
Reports
If advancement to the oral examination is approved, as outlined above, the Dean of the Faculty
of Graduate Studies shall provide electronic copies of all reports to each of the advisor/coadvisor, examiners and Head of the unit.
5.12 The Oral Examination
5.12.1 Scheduling
Units cannot proceed with scheduling the oral defence prior to receiving the approved examiners
report from the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The examination must be held at the University of
Manitoba. It is the responsibility of the unit to ensure that all room booking arrangements are
made and appropriate facilities meet minimum standards expected for a Ph.D. defence. In
addition, the candidate must submit, in electronic format biographical information and an abstract
of the thesis to the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.12.2 Attendance
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies or designate shall act as Chair of the examination
committee.
The attendance of the external examiner in person at the candidate’s oral examination is
encouraged. If the external examiner will not be present in person, his/her participation via video
conferencing is expected.
It is required that all internal members of the examining committee be present at the defence,
unless exceptional circumstances prevent this and with prior approval of the Dean of the Faculty
of Graduate Studies. Regardless, no more than two participants can use video conferencing.
Under no circumstances can the candidate participate by video conferencing.
Normally, the oral examination shall be open to all members of the University of Manitoba
community and the general public. In exceptional cases the final oral examination may be
closed; for example, when the results of the thesis research must be kept confidential for a
period of time. In such cases, the examination committee and Head of the unit shall request prior
approval in writing from the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. If approved, the final oral
examination shall be closed to all but the examining committee and the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies or designate.
Regardless of open or closed status, no recording devices will be permitted.
5.12.3 Format of the Examination
The first part of the oral examination shall consist of an oral presentation by the candidate. This
is followed by examination of the candidate by the examination committee. If time permits the
Chair, at their discretion, may allow questions from members of the audience

5.12.4 Procedures for the Conduct of the Examination
The Chair should discuss the examination procedures with the examiners in camera prior to the
beginning of the formal examination.
The Chair will introduce the candidate and request him/her to give a concise (20 to 25 minute)
oral presentation of the thesis to include a summary of the problem addressed, the results
obtained and the conclusions drawn from the study.
Following the presentation, the Chair will invite questions from each member of the examining
committee, taking care to ensure that each examiner has approximately equal time for questions.
The total time for questions by the examining committee must not exceed two (2) hours.
The Chair may exercise his/her discretion in allowing questions from the audience following
completion of the formal examination. Once assuming the role of Chair, he/she foregoes the right
to comment on the merits of the thesis whether or not he/she is an expert in the field.
5.12.5 Decision of the Committee:
Following completion of the formal examination, the candidate and audience must leave the
examination room. The decision of the examining committee will be based both on the content of
the thesis and on the candidate's ability to defend it.
The judgement of the examiners shall be reported by the Chair to the Faculty of Graduate
Studies in the qualitative terms “pass” or “fail” on the “Final Examination of the Ph.D. Thesis”
form.

•

•

Pass: the candidate has satisfactorily presented their findings orally and answered, to
the satisfaction of the examination committee, the methodology, observations and
conclusions presented in the thesis. The advisor/co-advisor is charged with ensuring
that any minor editorial or typographical revisions are satisfactorily completed. Those
examiners in agreement must indicate, by their signatures, concurrence with the
passing grade.
Fail: the candidate has failed to adequately orally present, or satisfactorily respond to
questions posed related to, the thesis. This shall include significant defects in
conception, methodology or context. Those examiners in agreement must indicate, by
his/her signature, concurrence with the failing grade.

If the external examiner or two or more internal examiners indicate a fail, the candidate fails the
examination. A copy of the report, including providing written detailed reasons for the decision,
will be made available to the candidate by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.13 Candidate Awards
The examination committee may recommend in writing to the Faculty of Graduate Studies that
the thesis is of sufficient merit to receive an award.
5.14 Graduation
The candidate will be recommended for the Ph.D. degree upon receipt by the Faculty of
Graduate Studies of favourable reports by the thesis examining committee, a corrected copy of
the electronic version of the thesis submitted to MSpace, final approval and release forms, and
providing all other degree requirements have been satisfied.
Patents –Refer to section 6 “Policy of Withholding Theses Pending Patent Applications” in this
Guide.
Restriction of Theses for Publication – In exceptional cases, not covered by the regulation
concerning patents, where adequate cause can be shown to delay publication, the student and
advisor may request in writing that the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies restrict access

for a period up to one year after the submission of the digital version of a thesis to The University
of Manitoba. The Dean shall determine for what period, if any, access will be so restricted.
Library and Archives Canada – Library and Archives Canada obtains a copy of the thesis via
the University’s MSpace repository.
5.15 Student Withdrawal
A student will be required to withdraw when the Ph.D. thesis has been rejected twice at the stage
where:
a)

The internal examining committee reports on the merits of the written thesis;

b) The external examiner reports on the merits of the written thesis;
c) The oral examination; or
d) A combination of any of these stages.

SECTION 6: Policy of Withholding Thesis Pending Patent Applications
Content or Manuscript Submission
In 1970 the University of Manitoba Board of Governors and Senate approved a policy on
accepting research grants from outside agencies. This policy defined the right of agencies to defer
release of information and thus ensure freedom of publications for research findings of University
personnel. Occasionally, the University may also wish to restrict the release of a thesis pending
patent application. For additional details, see the University of Manitoba governing document:
http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/community/235.html
This situation may arise in the two circumstances defined below, both of which are governed by
the same set of regulations.
1.

2.

Where a research project is known to contain patentable items as defined in the
research contract, then it is the responsibility of the advisor to give written information
of the restrictions on publication to the student prior to the start of the thesis research.
If the student agrees to carry out the research, then the regulation given below will
apply.
Where a patentable item is found during the course of research, then the advisor and
the student may make application for patent rights through the University Patent
Committee, and the following regulation will apply concerning the release of the thesis.

Regulations Concerning Release of a Thesis During Application and Negotiation For
Patents
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will receive the approved thesis. On written joint
request of the advisor and the student, the Dean will retain the thesis for a period not to exceed
one year.
Regulations Concerning Release of Thesis Pending Manuscript Submission
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will receive the approved thesis. On written joint
request of the advisor and the student, the Dean will keep the thesis for a period up to one year.

http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html and submit it to his/her major
unit for recommendation to the Faculty of Graduate Studies at least three, but no more than
four, months prior to expiration of the respective maximum time limit. Requests for an extension
are reviewed by the Faculty of Graduate Studies on a case by case basis.
Requests for extension must be accompanied by a realistic timeline that has been agreed upon
by the student and advisor/co-advisor and endorsed by the unit Head. The extension time
requested must closely reflect the time required to complete the program.
The normal time requested for extensions is four to eight months. More than one
extension period may be considered. However the total approved for all extensions will
not normally exceed one year.

Section 8: Leaves of Absence
8.1 Regular Leave
A regular leave is intended to allow students to meet responsibilities/plans related to family, travel
or employment and circumstances not covered by the parental or exceptional leaves. At the
student’s request, the Head of the unit may recommend to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies that a student be granted a leave of absence for a period of time not to exceed one year.
While on leave of absence, a student would not be expected to conduct study and/or thesis
research work. Students on regular leaves of absence will be required to maintain continuous
registration and pay the appropriate continuing fee. If a student has program tuition fees (as
opposed to continuing fees) owing at the time of the granting of the leave, the tuition
fees will be deferred until the student returns from leave; however, the continuing fee will be
levied.* A regular leave of absence status does not extend the time limits as outlined in Faculty
of Graduate Studies regulations.
*Program Fees: The continuing fee in effect at the time of the granting of the leave will be levied.
However, if the student returns from leave in January, the normal tuition fee will be levied less the
continuing fee already paid.
8.2 Exceptional Leave
In exceptional circumstances for medical or compassionate reasons (e.g. the need to care for an
ailing family member), at the request of the student the Head of the unit may recommend to the
Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies that a student be granted an exceptional leave of
absence for a period of time not to exceed one year. While on an exceptional leave of absence,
a student is not permitted to maintain study and/or thesis research work, would not be required to
maintain continuous registration, nor pay tuition fees. In addition, the leave period would not be
included in the time period allowed for the completion of the degree. This leave is not intended to
cover circumstances related to travel, employment or financial concerns.
8.2.1 Fees
Students are not expected to pay fees for the term in which they have been granted an
exceptional leave. Upon return from the exceptional leave, students will be assessed fees as
determined by the Registrar’s Office.
8.3 Parental Leave
A graduate student who is expecting a child or who has primary responsibility of the care of an
infant or young child immediately following a birth or adoption of a child is eligible for parental
leave. The request should be made through the unit, normally for a leave of four to twelve
months. Leaves of other duration will be considered on an individual basis. Parental leaves must
correspond with (an) academic term(s). While on leave of absence for parental reasons, a student
is not permitted to maintain study and/or thesis research work. The leave period is not included in
the time period allowed for completion of the degree.
8.3.1 Fees
Students are not expected to pay fees for the term in which they have been granted a parental
leave. Upon return from the parental leave students will be assessed fees as determined by the

Registrar’s Office.
Note: At the time of approval of an application for leave, the procedures for the return of the
student to the unit at the completion of the leave must be stipulated.
8.4 Awards and Leave of Absence
Students granted exceptional or parental leave will retain the full value of a University of
Manitoba Graduate Fellowship or other award whose terms and conditions are established by
the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Such an award will be suspended at the onset of the leave and
reinstated at the termination of the leave period (4 to 12 months) provided that the student
returns to full time study at that time.
Note: Other awards will be paid according to the conditions established by the donor or granting
agency.
8.5 Graduate Student Vacation Entitlement
Students are entitled to three weeks of vacation over a 12-month period.

SECTION 9: Appeals – Procedures and Guidelines
9.1 General
Students who disagree with a decision have access to appeal routes as laid out by various
Faculty of Graduate Studies and University of Manitoba appeal procedures. Student appeals
may be limited by the scope of the inquiry available at each level and category of appeal, as well
as the time limitations for submission of appeals.
A further limitation is that the Faculty of Graduate Studies rules and regulations, established to
uphold the academic rigour of the University of Manitoba, are generally not subject to appeal
unless an appeal route is otherwise stipulated. In situations where no appeal route is available, a
student may make a written request to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Students are referred to the appeals section of the University of Manitoba Governing Documents
(http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/index.html) for further details.
For students registered in Joint Master's Programs (University of Manitoba and University of
Winnipeg) there is a different process for handling appeals and academic dishonesty cases than
for University of Manitoba students in regular programs (not Joint Programs). This process is
outlined in the Joint Master's Program Governing Documents available at
http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/media/JMP_Regulations.pdf.

1.5 Additional Materials
1.5.1 Consent and Access to Information Forms
Sample copies of consent forms that were used to obtain consent from participants to take part
in the information gathering procedures for the thesis/practicum must be included in an
Appendix. Any personal information must be omitted from the submitted form.
In some cases, approval from an agency, institution or corporation may have been required
before the information gathering procedures could proceed. The original approval form for
access should be retained by the student with a copy provided to the Faculty of Graduate
Studies upon completion of the thesis/practicum.
1.5.2 Use of Copyrighted Material
If the thesis/practicum includes copyrighted material (images or more than a reasonable extract
(according to the Copyright Act) of another person’s work), permission must be obtained from the
copyright holder. The Faculty of Graduate Studies has developed a form
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html) that can be utilized when
requesting the use of copyrighted material.
In some cases, copyright holders prefer to use their own permission forms and/or will provide
their permission electronically. Both of these are acceptable by the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Note that obtaining permission may take a considerable amount of time and this must be taken
into consideration when meeting a thesis/practicum submission deadline. A reference to written
permission having been obtained must be included under the image or text. The reference
should also include the date the permission was granted, and the name/title of the copyright
holder(s). The original form(s) signed by the copyright holders should be retained by the student
with a copy provided to the Faculty of Graduate Studies at the completion of the
thesis/practicum.
The thesis/practicum cannot be accepted by the Faculty of Graduate Studies if permission has
not been obtained. It is important that the student and their Advisor ensure that the permission
has been granted. In some cases, the copyright holder cannot be located or the cost is
prohibitive to using the text or image. In these situations, the text or image may have to be
omitted from the thesis/practicum.
Subsequently, information on where the reader can locate the image or text should be included,
such as the URL, title of book/journal, volume and issue number, page number, publisher, and
date of publication. A description of the purpose or significance of the text or image should be

provided.
For further information on copyright
see: http://umanitoba.ca/admin/vp_admin/ofp/copyright/index.html
2.0 Manuscript/Grouped Manuscript Style
A thesis/practicum may comprise a paper, or collection of papers, which are, or are about to be,
published. The number of papers that comprise this style of these will be determined between
the student and the advisory committee. The formatting of the thesis/practicum must be
consistent throughout the thesis/practicum and the thesis/practicum cannot merely consist of
several papers or articles bound within the one document.
Publication, or acceptance for publication, of research results prior to the presentation of
the thesis/practicum does not supersede the evaluation of the work by the examination
committee (i.e. does not guarantee that the thesis/practicum will be found acceptable).
Examiners may specify revisions regardless of the publication status.
The thesis/practicum must follow the same prefatory information (1.1), spelling, formatting
margin requirements, page numbering (1.2b-d), footnotes and appendices (1.3), figures,
illustrations photographs and drawings (1.4) and any additional material (1.5) as those outlined
above.
There must be an introductory chapter to the entire thesis/practicum which includes its
own bibliography. The collection of papers or articles must contribute toward the overall
theme that represents the thesis/practicum work and must be smoothly integrated into
the flow of the thesis/practicum to produce a unified document. This may require changes
or additions to, and re-writing of, any work which has been previously published.
The thesis/practicum must contain connecting text between the different chapters
providing logical links to allow the integration of the information. These connecting
sections are mandatory. Not including these sections may compromise the ability of the
examiners to evaluate the thesis/practicum and accordingly there may be subsequent
potential consequences.
The thesis/practicum must contain a concluding chapter that includes a discussion on how the
thesis/practicum, with its findings, provides a distinct contribution to knowledge in the research
area.
In the case of multi-authored papers, the nature and extent of the student/candidate’s
contribution, and those of the other authors, must be explicitly specified in a section
entitled "Contributions of Authors" in the “Preface” of the thesis/practicum. The
advisor/co-advisor, by signing the thesis/practicum submission form, attests to the
accuracy of these statements and will be asked to reaffirm at the oral defence in the case
of a doctoral thesis/practicum.

Master of Human Rights

Statement

The Libraries' collection can support this new programme, as described in the documentation
provided to UML. However, ongoing support may be impacted by a weak Canadian dollar,
inflationary increases in subscription costs, and any reductions to the Libraries' acquisitions
budget. Library staff costs are also incurred in the support of, and services to, the Introduction of
new courses.
The Libraries currently holds 48 out of a list of 65 reference titles, or 74%. A list of 122 relevant
periodicals was generated and checked against the Libraries' holdings. The Libraries currently
subscribe to 97 titles (80%) with an additional 15 titles (12%) available after a 6·24 month
embargo period. A check of 2,262 citations from 7 sources indicates that the overall monograph
and journal collections are both at a doctoral level (80-94 %) in the area of human rights.
The Libraries' collection lacks 14 monograph titles, out of the 106 titles listed in the
supplementary readings for the proposed courses. Pending programme approval, these titles
can be purchased for approximately $400 CAD from existing acquisition funds.
UML also has an efficient document delivery service which can supply articles or monographs
not held In the collections. Graduate programmes are also supported by libraries' staff through
the provision of information services Including research consultations, reference assistance,
seminars and assistance with institutional repository deposit.

Master in Human Rights Appendix

Human rights materials are found mostly in Elizabeth Dafoe Library, E.K. Williams Law Library
and Fr. H. Drake (St. Paul's College) Library. The National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation
will also be an important resource for the study of human rights, and their literarure resources
will be identifiable via the Libraries' One Stop Search and catalogue. For all checking below1 the
holdings of all University of Manitoba Libraries were taken into account.

Reference Material Checking

While every effort will be made to retain these journals, continuing access will depend on

Monographic Checking
In checking citations for monographic items, the holdings of all University of Manitoba Libraries
were taken into account. Monograph citations from one text from the supplied course
bibliography for each of HMRT 7100, 7200 and 7300 were checked. As no course bibliography
was supplied for the Human Rights Practicum course. three monographs with a broad or
interdisciplinary focus were chosen. Citations from the bibliographies were checked in the
Library catalogue with the following exclusions: non-English titles, theses, unpublished
material, working papers, government publications (except Canadian government publications),
and URLs. If o later edition of a title was held by the University of Manitoba Libraries, but the
cited edition was not, the title was considered held. It was not considered held if only an earlier
edition of the cited title was held.

Re:

Proposal for a Master of Human Rights

Having reviewed the program proposal for a Masters of Human Right, I see no problems in the Registrar's
Office supporting this program with respect to registration , fee assessment and academic evaluation. I
note that the plans for this program include the conversion of a classroom in St. Paul's College. The
details of this conversion to space that supports the Master of Human Rights program will need to be
coordinated between St. Paul's College, the Registrar's Office and Campus Planning.

Best of luck with your proposal.

Dear President Barnard,
As deans of three of the four other faculties collaborating with Graduate Studies on the Master of
Human Rights (MHR), we are writing to express our support for the proposal currently under review by
various levels of university governance prior to submission to the Manitoba government.
Three of our faculty councils have already voted to approve the MHR proposal In principal, with the final
vote pending in Arts. The Dean of Arts has elected not to sign this letter until after Arts Faculty Council
has had an opportunity to deliberate on its support. Some of our faculty members, including the Canada
Research Chair in Human Rights, Social Justice and Food Sovereignty, are eager to participate in the new
program as thesis supervisors, course instructors and program committee members. Many are happy to
welcome MHR students into existing graduate courses. We will do our best to facilitate the involvement
of our faculty members in the MHR, subject to the needs of their home departments.
We have reviewed a recent draft of the Master of Human Rights proposal, which we understand may
undergo further revisions following external review. We are confident that this program will attract high
quality graduate students who might not otherwise consider the University of Manitoba.
We are relieved that the new program will not create financial burdens for our Individual faculties,
which are struggling to adequately resource existing programs, since the MHR Is expected to attract
significant donor support. However, we will request through the upcoming Strategic Resource Planning
process that the university supplement this with startup funding from the university's operating budget
allocation for strategic priorities. Human rights is one of the university's major research themes and the
MHR program clearly aligns with the university's "inspiring minds" and "forging connections" priorities.
Please note that our support for the MHR proposal is contingent on sufficient external funding being
secured to support the program.
An interdisciplinary Master of Human Rights program has been discussed for many years, but we feel
that now is the time to move ahead, given the range of faculty members who have worked on or
attached their names to the current proposal.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Dear President Barnar~

I am writing to express my support for the Master of Human Rights proposal currently under review by
various university committees prior to submission to the Manitoba government.
While the Arts Faculty Council bas not yet met to indicate its position on the proposal, many of our
faculty members have participated in the development of the program and are keen to be involved in its
delivery. I will do my best to facilitate the involvement of Arts faculty members in the Masters of Human
Rights, subject to the needs of the departments of which they are members and the Faculty as a whole.

I have reviewed a recent draft of the Master of Human Rights proposal, which I understand may undergo
further revisions following external review. 1 am confident that this program will attract high quality
graduate students who might not otherwise consider the University of Manitoba
I am relieved that the new program will not create financial burdens for individual Faculties, which are
struggling to adequately resource existing programs. The program has been designed to be resource
neutral for the Faculty of Arts, and my understanding is that outside funding will be obtained to ensure
that, after initial startup, the new program will not draw on existing University resources.
An interdisciplinary Master of Human Rights program has been discussed for many years, and now is the
time to move ahe~ given the range of faculty members who have worked on or attached their names to

Dear Dr. Barnard,
Please accept this letter of support for the establishment of the degree of Master of Human
Ri ghts (MHR) at the University of Manitoba. For many years the Arthur V. Mauro Centre for
Peace and Justice at St. Paul 's College has been working collaboratively with a range of
stakeholders in the university and broader community to have this new degree established.
The Mauro Centre is located in the south wing of St. Paul 's College with oversight by the St.
Paul 's College's Board of Governors as well as the Arthur V. Mauro Centre Board of Directors.
The Arthur V. Mauro Centre for Peace and Justice is dedicated to the advancement of human
rights, conflict resolution, global citizenship, peace, and social justice through research,
education, and outreach. Since its inception, the Centre has pursued activities relating to the
cultural, religious, and philosophical dimensions of peace, social, economic, and environmental
justice, peace education, human rights, and the role of international organizations and standards
in the quest for peace and justice. The Centre is also interested in the role of the Abrahamic
religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and in pointing ways for people to live in peace and
harmony in a post-modern world.
The Joint M.A. Program in Peace and Conflict Studies (which is governed jointly by the
University of Manitoba and the University of Winnipeg) is housed at the Mauro Centre and the
University of Winnipeg's Global College. The Centre is also home to the University of
Manitoba's Ph.D. Program in Peace and Conflict Studies which, through the Faculty of Graduate
Studies, seeks to prepare leaders in a multiplicity of contexts who can make a difference locally,
nationally, and globally.
Graduate students who are enrolled in the Peace and Conflict Studies (PACS) program are
eligible to receive numerous scholarships and awards, most of which are funded by donors, and
stewarded and administered through the St. Paul's College Foundation. In addition to fundraising
and stewardship in support of PACS, St. Paul's College has dedicated an extensive amount of

office and study space for students and faculty who are involved in the Peace and Conflict
Studies program.
Should the University of Manitoba seek to locate a newly established Master of Human Rights in
St. Paul's College, a building currently owned by St. Paul's College Limited, the College's
Board of Governors is prepared to consider a proposal to set aside two currently occupied offices
on the top floor of its South Wing as well as to permit the University convert two classrooms into
a study carrel and meeting area to serve both MHR and PACS graduate students. While this
portion of our College's building could be offered without charge through a renewable lease
agreement, additional funds would be required to upgrade the faculty offices and study space, as
well as to instal l an elevator to service this area.
Regardless of whether or not the University is seeking to use this space, I join with my
colleagues at the Arthur V. Mauro Centre for Peace and Justice in expressing its support for new
and ongoing efforts being made towards establishing this new degree.

Letter of Support, Master of Human Rights Program
Winnipeg is the cradle of the Canadian disability rights movement. National disability
organizations located in Winnipeg were instrumental in the development and ultimate passage of
the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2010), to which Canada is a
signatory.
It is only fitting that the University of Manitoba’s Disability Studies Program be actively
involved and support the proposed Master of Human Rights. People with disabilities have been
part of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights process regarding access and exhibits for the
last ten years, through the Council of Canadians with Disabilities.
The Master of Human Rights will provide yet another opportunity for the University of
Manitoba’s various interdisciplinary programs, among them Disability Studies, to work together.
We can share information and insights. Each program will be stronger as we learn and share with
each other, including through a new Graduate Social Justice Programs co-ordinating committee.
Social, social justice, citizenship and rights-based disciplines can work together to share
information resources, gaining greater depth of knowledge for students as a result. Although the
Disability Studies Program is small, we can provide elective courses, guest speakers and thesis
committee members for the benefit of MHR students.

Dear President Barnard,
1 am writing to express wholehearted support for the interdisciplinary Master of Human Rights (MHR)
program proposal being developed jointly by the faculties of Arts, Law, Social Work and Education.
The idea has been floated in the past, but events have aligned to make this the perfect time to move
forward:
The University of Manitoba's Canada Research Chair in Human Rights (one of only four in Canada)
is eager lo help lead this initiative.
The university recently identified human rights as one of seven major research themes and has set
ambitious goals to increase the number of graduate students enrolled.
The openfog of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights has drawn international attention to
Winnipeg.
Motions supportive of the MHR have been passed by councils in at least three faculties.
Donors have tentatively committed to helping support the master's program.
On May 30, 2013, representatives of our research centre and the Mauro Centre for Peace and Justice met
with VP John Kearsey to brainstorm about how to take human rights at the University of Manitoba to the
next JeveJ. We agreed that two missing pieces were a master's degree program in human rights and a
University 1 course in human rights. The current initiative is an effort to fill one of those gaps,
Centre for Human Rights Research advisory board members are among the MHR's most enthusiastic
supporters, including several faculty members who volunteered to help write the proposal. It is clear to us
that increasing the number of graduate students at the University of Manitoba focusing on human rights
complements our research centre's mandate to enhance the university's collaborative human dghts
research capacity.
At a preliminary meeting of MHR stakeholders Nov. 29, 2013, I volunteered to co-ordinat~ proposal
writing. Our research centre will continue to assist with proposal development until the program is
approved and a director is appointed . I am also committed to sitting on the committee that will run the
new program and providing practical startup advice to the new director, as I do for the director of the
National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation. The Centre for Human Rights Research may be able to hire
some MHR students as part-time research assistants.
Thank you for your leadership in promoting human rights at this university and please feeJ free to contact
me if you have any questions.
Sincerely,

rof. Karen Busby

August 4, 20 15

Dea President Barnard,
I would like to express the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation's enthusiastic support for the
interdisciplinary Master of Human Rights (MHR) program under development by the faculties of Art:.,
Law, Social Work, Education and Graduate Studies.
Our research and education centre is one of three such centres based at the University of Manitoba 1hat
have agreed to assist those five faculties with MHR program development and governance.
As you well know, the NCTR was created to preserve forever the memory of Canada's Residential
School system and legacy. We will care for a massive electronic archive that will eventually grow to
include other Indigenous collections. These materials will be a rich resource for Master of Human
Rights students pursuing research related to the history of human rights and new approaches to
reconciliation.
The NCTR will likely be able to hire some MHR students as part-time research assistants and
collaborate with some students on thesis projects. A few graduates of the program may well end up on
our staff. We also foresee many opportunities for joint programming, such as lectures, workshops and
summer institutes, where MHR students would interact with the communities served by the NCTR. This
is the kind of creative community engagement highlighted in the university's new strategic plan.
The opening of our centre and of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights makes this the ideal time to
create a new Winnipeg-based master' s program in human rights. These complementary initiatives wilJ
ensure the University of Manitoba becomes known internationally as a centre for human rights
education and research.
The NRTR is committed to providing a representative to sit on the committee that will run this exciting
new graduate program.
Please contact me if you would like to discuss this further.
Sincerely,

---

Re: University of Manitoba Masters of Human Rights program

To Whom it May Concern :
The Canadian Museum for Human Rights would like to voice its support for the proposed Masters of
Human Rights program at the University of Manitoba. We welcome the development of further human
rights educational initiatives in Winnipeg which harmonize with the Museum' s mandate to explore the
subject of human rights, with special but not exclusive reference to Canada, in order to enhance the
public's understanding of human rights, to promote respect for others and to encourage reflection and
dialogue.
There may be many opportunities for cooperation between the Museum and the Masters of Human
Rights program. These opportunities potentially include hosting practicum students from the program,
conditional on the Museum's work flow and capacity to offer a beneficial experience to st udents.

We

are interested in further dialogue with the program coordinators to identify and define cooperative
initiatives, moving forward.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Barnard,
Please accept this letter as strong support for the establishment of an inter-disciplinary
Master of Human Rights at the University of Manitoba. As background, I am a graduate
and Celebrated Alumnus of the University of Manitoba who worked for over a decade with
the United Nations. My last position was as Director of Research at the United Nations
Office of the High Commissioner in Geneva, and I previously worked with the United
Nations Development Programme in Asia and the Pacific as well as Central Europe and the
former Soviet Union, and with the Canadian Department of Justice in Ottawa.
I have observed the impact that well qualified Canadians can have in advancing the human
rights mission of the United Nations and civil society. As you know, human rights are
vitally interconnected with peace and development today. A keen and nuanced grasp of
these issues, their inter-linkages, and an understanding of promising models of promotion
and protection of the full range of human rights, are necessary for international civil
servants and Canadian representatives to the United Nations to successfully fulfil their
roles. The proposed Masters Program has the potential to, among other aims, equip
students at the University of Manitoba with the requisite knowledge to successfully fulfill
these complex and important multilateral roles.
Now that the Canadian Museum of Human Rights has opened in Winnipeg to raise
awareness of current and past rights issues, I am hopeful that the University of Manitoba
will create a graduate programme to enable its students to shape the future human rights
situation globally.
Yours sincerely,

Marcia V.J. Kran

Dear President Barnard

I write with reference to the proposal for a University of Manitoba Master of
Human Rights (MHR) program. Having worked for the past 15 years in the
international legal sphere, including in the field of human rights, I wish to voice
my strong support for the proposal.
In my experience, there is a clear need for academic programs in this area
generally. The past 15 years have brought significant developments in human
rights law and practice and an expansion of work opportunities for lawyers trained
in this specific field. While some academic curriculums have developed as a result,
from my experience they do not match the growth in the subject and its ever
expanding appl ications.
From a pragmatic perspective, as discussed in the proposal, there is a vast range of
career options available to an individual with a Master degree in the field. I wou ld
note that in addition to the various possibilities listed, there is growing demand for
advocates to conduct human rights litigation both at the domestic and international
level.

It also strikes me as highly appropriate that the University of Manitoba, located in
the province which is home to the Human Rights museum and other important
initiatives in this area, would host such a program. I believe as well that the
program as articulated is highly innovative and would be unique within Canada
and beyond.
As to the content, I am struck by the multidisciplinary approach proposed which I
believe captures the practical reality of human rights practice today. It is a field
which spans disciplines and any program related to the subject area should be
similarly broad in approach.
During my five years as Ombudsperson for the Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee I
have seen first-hand the need for attention to human rights concerns in all aspects
of the work of the United Nations, including that of the Security Council. It would
162

be wonderful to have the University of Manitoba, making an important
contribution to this critical field by training future human rights advocates, policy
makers, defenders and leaders.
I very much hope that the proposal will be accepted and implemented.
Yours sincerely

Dear Dr. Bnrnnrd:
I have lmd the opportunity lo review the University of Manitoba proposnl to establish n Master of
Hunrnn Rights progrnm, and am please<l lo oITer my cmlorsemcnl for this proposal. The proposed
1>rogrn111 will fill n growing demand for humnn rights studies, und will be n forenumcr in western
Cnnnun. TJ1e growing importance of humun rights pro gm ms in Cnnaclion universities, and their value
for lhe Province of Manitoba in particular, are mticulntcd well in the program proposal and will not be
repented here.
I will slmre my experience with Human Rights education. The University of Winnipeg Iaunche<l a BA
degree in lluman Rights in 2008, with very positive results, Sh1de11t interest !ms outstripped om modest
projections. Since the inception of this program, 57 students have graduated with this degree, and this
number is currently growing by 10-12 a year. Ma11y students in other programs have taken Human
Rights comses as electives, and last year we inlroduced a Minor in Human Rights as well. A number of
our graduates are interested in pursuing advanced degrees in Human Rights, and the proposed MHR
could fill that need. Based on queries that I have received from students seeking graduntc studies in
Human Rights, lam confident that the program will attract studcuts from otlier provinces nnd countries
as well.

The proposed pl'ogram is a creative complement to exisling Masters programs in Manitoba, including
the Joint MA in Peace and Conflict Stu<lies offered by our two universities, and will open additional
opportunities for joinl projects nnd collegial collaboration between Global College and our colleagues
nt the University of Manitoba.
I commend your colleagues on the work they have done iu preparing this proposal, and look forwnrd to
seeing it implemented.

Dear Dr. Barnard,
I am writing to offer my support for the proposed Masters in Human Rights program at the
University of Manitoba. As both a Canadian, and the coordinator of a graduate program
dealing extensively with lluman rights issues, I am convinced that the creation of such a
program would serve to fulfill a great need in Canada. While there are many Canadians
engaged in human rights work in Canada and globally there is a lack of adequate interdisciplinary graduate programs in human rights in Canada. As a consequence many
Canadians, such as myself, have felt the need to leave Canada to study at interdisciplinary
centres in Europe and the United States.
The proposed Masters in Human Rights program would be unique m the Canadian
university system. As such I believe the program could potentially draw students from
across Canada., as well as foreign students. The program would be well-situated in
Winnipeg, where it could benefit from the presence of the Canadian Museum for Human
Rights and other human rights institutions.
Through supporting the MHR program the University of Manitoba could increase its
international profile, as well as establish itself as a Canadian leader in the field of human
rights research, training, and education.

Dear Professor Woolford,

I am writing lo express strong support for the establishment of your new inter·
disciplinary Master of Human Rights degree program. I have reviewed the proposal and
believe the initiative is well.conceived, thorough, and will be of great interest to students
and other members of your scholarly community.
It also synergizes with other initiatives at or related to the University of Manitoba,
including the Centre for Human Rights Research lojtiative (CHRR), the new Canadian
Museum of Human Rights, and the recent establishment of the National Research Centre
on residential schools.

In adwtion, there are a number of scholars at the university who work on human
righls·related issues, including, for example, scholars who have established close ties to
indigenous commuruties in the area and have a history of working together with them.
This sort of university-community relationship would further enhance your proposed
degree program.
1 should note that the program I direct, the Center for the Study of Genocide and
Human Rights has a long·standing relationship with the University of Manitoba. We have
a partnership agreement with the Centre for Human Rights Research Initiative and
collaborated to co-host an international conference on Colonial Genocide in Indigenous
North America that resulted in a 20 15 volume published by Duke University Press.
1n keeping wilh this long-standing relationship, our Center would be happy to
explore future collaborations, such as cooperating and co-organizing learning
opportunities and events, ranging from thematic conference to seminar . Other

possibilities might include student exchanges, guest lectures, collaborative course

Re: Graduate Programme Proposal Master of Human Rights
Dear Dr. Barnard,
It js with great pleasure that I offer my unqualified support for the proposed

interdisciplinary Master of Human Rights degree programme and recommend its
implementation by the Uruversity of Manitoba. While 1 write this letter in my capacity as
longtime chair of the Freeman Family Foundation I-IolocaustEducation Centre of the
Jewish Heritage Centre of Western Canada and as one of the nine Canadian delegates of
the IHRA Qntemational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance), I must also state from the
outset that the proposal is also very relevant to some of the other "hats I wear," namely,
as vice-president of the Manitoba Multifaith Council and as a current graduate student at
the University of Winnipeg.

1 have taken the time to review the proposal in detail and was particularly impressed with
the interdisciplinary approach that would in my opini6n, attract a great number of
students pursuing careers in many different fields. It also provides the opportunity of
course, for a very enriching experience with the scholars available to them from such
diverse fields as education, law and other disciplines of the social sciences. The history
of Canada with its record of achievements and failures in the area of human rights
perhaps best exemplified most recently with the work of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission affords a logical fit. With the opening ofthe Canadian ·Museum for Human
Rights and the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation at the University of
Manitoba, Winnipeg is becoming a centre of excellence for researche.t;S in the field of
human rights; a programme at the graduate level seems the next naturaJ step.
There are students studying all over Canada and in other countries that I believe would
have a keen interest in this program.me. I am certain that other experts in their various
fields will be mentioning the particular, natural and logical associations with their own
diverse fields, such as immigration and human rights law, social work, etc. However, l
will limit myself to those areas to which 1 have a particular connection. I believe that the
education field will be oarticu1arlv well served
168bv the oooortunitv for educators to studv

human rights at the graduate level. The human rights curricula across our country (and
indeed in North America) continue to be of a concern to me. Certainlyt in my own work,
I see a wide disparity in the manner in which the teaching of the Holocaust and other
genocides is approached. I am astounded, on the other hand, by the quality of work being
done in cowitries throughout Europ~ and the UK, and often wonder why Canada has
lagged behind. I can imagine potential theses resulting from offering this degree that
would in tum have positive implications on the way we teach genocide in Canada-from
the elementary years to the post-secondary level.
As a person engaged in and promoting multifaith dialogue, I am currently pursuing a
graduate degree in dialogue theology. I believe that the MHR degree will add
significantly to the possibilities available to those who are yery much engaged in this area
yet are not oriented toward a career in ministry. Certainly, as 1he composition of
Canada's multicultural society is changing and becomes less Eurocentric, it becomes
difficult to find a graduate degree for those who wish to study the concept of dialogue
from a non-Christian approach. Dialogue is an area that is so vast, extending from
religion to politics to law~ etc. and the interdisciplinary method seems the perfect way to
approach this topic. As well, while the topics of global ethics and human rights are
explored in the both the graduate programmes offered in Theology, Indigenous
Governance and Indigenous Development Practice at the University of Winnipeg, they
are generally limited in.scope to Canadian issues. Looking at the list of schoJars who
might be teaching in the MHR programme, I can envision broader possibilities for
students.
I believe that students in the MHR programme could be a wonderful resource for the

Freeman Family Foundation Holocaust Education Centre as we move forward. I can also
imagine students developing prognmuniag for us and we in tum providing guest
lectureships to the programme-- such as survivors, people who have interviewed them or
second-generation of survivors. The Manitoba Multifaith Council provides an
opportunity to access several different faith communities through their representatives
and as such provide networking and research opportunities.
Several months ago, I attended an international conference in Manchester. Delegates
from around the world crowded around me and another delegate from Winnipeg. The
question on everyone's lips was the same: "Tell us about your wonderful new musewn!"
I believe that this progratnme will be another world-class initiative that will make
Winnipeg a world-class centre for scholarship and research. I wish to congratulate those
who have had the extraordinary vision to imagine such a programme.
Sincerely,

Dr. David Barnard
President of the University of Manitoba
University of Manitoba, Canada
Dear Dr. Barnard,
On behalf of the Permanent Mission of Costa Rica to the United Nations, I would
like to refer to the University of Manitoba in regard of the Academic Master
Program of Human Rights that it is currently initiating.
In this regard, Human Rights have been historically a fundamental condition in
the national policies of Costa Rica. The history of Costa Rica is rich in laws and
institutional actions in order to guarantee the fundamental rights and freedom of
our citizens.
Human Rights have been the central pillar of the foreign Costa Rican policy. Our
country was one of the main contributors of the Universal Declaration of the
Human Rights and the first one to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights created by the United Nations. Education in human rights has also
been a key issue in our agenda.
Therefore, we support initiatives in the academic field that can contribute to create
knowledge and capacity in human rights. We hope that your new Master Program
of Human Rights is successful and can make a positive impact in the benefit of
humanity and the future generations.
I avail myself of this opportunity, the assurances of my highest consideration.
With regards,

Dear Dr. Barnard:
f am an Instmctor in the fields of human rights and conflict resolution studies who is writing to
support the proposal to establish a Masters in Human Rights program at the University of
Manitoba based on a lack of similar sought-after programs in Canada, highlighting the types of
careers graduates would be able to pursue. As someone who has enmed a postsecondary education
specializing in human rights at the University of Essex, National University of Jreland, Galway
and Middlesex University, I can personally attest to the added value of offering an MA program in
human rights at a local level.

The postsecondary study of human rights is growing on a global level, witl1 world-leading MA
programs offered at the London School of Economics, University College London, Essex Human
Rights Centre, Irish Centre for Human Rights, Rutgers University, Utt·echt University, Columbia
University and countless others. Encouraging local undergraduate students to continue/pursue
postsecondary education al the University of Manitoba and attracting intemational students hinges
on offering a diverse range of programs competitive against those offered abroad. Though there
are other rnastel's programs offered in related areas, such as an LLM concentrated in social justice
at the University of Ottawa, none has an overt focus on human rights.
Pursuing a Masters in Human Rights is the next logical step for students who have earned a
Bachelor of At'ls in Human Rights and wish to continue their education. At present, such students
are forced to study abroad and may choose not to retum to Canada to pursue their caree1·s. With at
least nine BA programs in human rights offered by prominent universities across Canada, ttus
presents a significant missed oppo1tunity for Canadian universities.
Launching a Maslel''s in Human Rights at the University of Manitoba would enable graduates to
pmsue a variety of ca1•ee1·s. At the provincial goverrunent level, graduates of the program could
become Human Rights Officers at the Manitoba Commission fol' Human Rights, or draw from
their expe11ise to infonn the shaping of government progran1s, policies and laws in any
goverrunent department. Graduates cot~d take on a similar role in the federal goverrunent, or take
on more expressly human rights focused work for the Office of the Ombudsman or for the

171

Canadian Human Rights Conunission. With ovel' 4000 nongovernmental organizations (NGO)
fo1mally recognized by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, graduates have ample
opportunity to become involved in NGO wmk locally, regionally and at an international level.
Other similar opportunities include working with civil society or non-profit organizations. Finally,
though not exhaustively, graduates may also apply their knowledge to the area of human
resources, ensuring that human rights are respected in the workplace.
As of 1 July 2015, I will commence a new position as Assistant Professor in Human Rights and
Director of the Atlantic Centre fo1· Human Rights. My Di.l'ectorship with the Centre could
potentially create opportunities for collaboration, including professional development
opportunities for MA students in human rights. I would likewise be pleased to continue my
suppo1t tluough consultation with the University as this program unfolds, should it be approved.
Establishing a Master's in Human Rights at the University of Manitoba presents an oppo1tunity for
the University to be a leader in a quickly growing field, for which Winnipeg is becoming known,
particulady with the recenl erection of the Canadian Museum of Human Rights. Offering this
program addresses several gaps in Canadian highel' education, will encourage existing students to
remain in Manitoba for their postgraduate studies while attracting international students, and will
better position graduates to embark on careers in their chosen field.
Sincerely,

Dear President David Barnard,
I would like to commend the faculty and leadership of the University of Manitoba for its proposal to cteate a
Master of Human Rights program. My owo work as the d.i.cector of the Toronto office of Facing History and
Ourselves (www.facingh.istory.org), very much aligns with_ the proposed scope of the program. Facing History
supports educators as they teach their students about some of rhe greatest human rights abuses in history. Our
pedagogical approach engages students in learning that history is made up of the choices that individuals make,
and that therefore their own choices matters. Through the study of history, our students become civ.ically
engaged global citizens.
For the last two yea.rs, I have been a presenter at the Teaching and Leadership for Human Rights Education
Summer Institute co-sponsored by the Uciversity of Manitoba and the Canadian Museum of Human Rights. I
have been impressed by the facuJty I have worked with in the delivery of this program, as well as the student
participants from the Universiry's Department of Education. Educators today are expressing the need for more
professional development in the field of Human Rights. A 2013 Canadian Teachers Federation Survey reported
that 94 per cent of respondents said it was important for them to acquire tno.re knowledge and skills around ageappropriate methods for teaching about human rights. I do nol doubt that the Master in Human Rights
Program wouJd attract individuals with degrees in education who would like to deepen their knowledge in this
important field. The cross curricular narure. of th.is program would certainly graduate. indi,Tjduals prepared to
lead the field of human rights education. Graduates could not only go back into the classroom, but would also
be prepared for positions like my own, supporting other educators through the writing of new curricuJar
materials, and providing professional development.

In reading the proposal, I have no doubl that d1e Master of Human Rights Program at the. University of
Manitoba would be successful i.a attracting a high caliber of students. I personnlly would look forward to the
possibility of working with student from the program through internships and possible employment with Facing
Histo.ry and Ou.rselves. l would be delighted to teach studeors in the program as a guest lecturer or as a
presenter at Summer lnscirutes.
I fully support the development of a Master of Human Rights at the University of Manitoba.

RE: Letter of support for University of Manitoba Masters of Human Rights Program
Dear Dr. Barnard.
I am writing to express Inter Pares• enthusiastic support for the creation of a Masters of
Human Rights program at the University of Manitoba.
Inter Pares is a registered Canadian charity founded in 1975, and based in Ottawa but with
supporters across Canada, including many in Manitoba. Inter Pares currently works with
over 70 organizations around the world who share our analysis that poverty and injustice
are caused by inequalities within and between nations and who are working to promote
social and economic justice in their communities and societies. The promotion of human
rights and the use of human rights mechanisms is an important element of the programs of
many of our counterparts in many countries. We see a growing emphasis on human rights in
many thematic areas that affect the poor, including food security, women's empowerment,
trade, children and youth, and education.
Inter Pares frequently collaborates with professors and students from comparable programs
at universities across Canada as part of our work. The kind of Interdisciplinary graduatelevel education being proposed prepares students not only for work In Canada's non-profit
sector. but also for work with government, and other related fields . We feel that It is also an
excellent grounding for students who choose to apply their credentials and a human rights
lens to other sectors, such as journalism, and education. It has been our experience that
university programs focussed on human rights attract students from all over the world, and
from diverse communities within canadian society including various diasporas.
Winnipeg, as a key hub for Indigenous rights in Canada, as a focal point of the disability
rights movement, and as the new home of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, is an
ideal location to offer an interdiscipllnary Masters of Human Rights program.
Inter Pares looks forward to future opportunities for collaboration with the University of
Manitoba in engaging Canadians on human rights issues that affect us all, in Canada and
overseas.
Respectfully,

~

Dear President Barnard,
I am writing to you in support of the Graduate Program Proposal, Master of Human
Rights at the University of Manitoba. 1 recently ended my ten year tenure as the Vicechair and Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. The Tribunal administers
the Canadian Human Rights Act, more specifically, hears and decides, through written
decisions, human rights complaints referred to it by the federal Human Rights
Commission.
In the past four decades following the enactment of the CHRA, many of the Tribunal
decisions have found their way on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The result has
been an expanding recognition and protection of human rights in Canada including
disability, gender, ethnic/national origin, race, aboriginal, freedom from harassment, both
sexual and in employment, age, and hate messages.
The human rights process, federally and provincially is complaint driven and to a large
extent has been located in the domain of the lawyers and the courts. My experience, as a
decision-maker, is that there has been little appreciation or use by advocates or the courts
of sources such as international human rights norms found in treaties to which Canada is
a signatory. As well, the use of restorative justice within the human rights process has
only recently been introduced but is not yet broadly based in Canada.
Although there has been a significant expansion of human rights, in my view, it is time to
look beyond just the provisions of human rights legislation in order to deal with, as the
Proposal states ''the increasingly complex human rights challenges of the 21st century.
Human rights figure much more prominently in politics, business, policy, law, education
and movements for social change. The myriad of complex human rights issues
confronting Canada and the world are best tackled through a broad-based approach that
spans histories, cultures and academic disciplines."
The Proposal indicates that the University of Manitoba has identified human rights as one
of its six strategic priorities for academic enhancement and one of seven major research
themes. The MHR program can also draw on the broad expertise in human. rights
research and teaching that currently exists at the University of Manitoba.

175

In my assessment, to the extent that the Master of Human Rights (MHR) program will be
broadly interdisciplinary, branching into the sciences and taking advantage of expertise in
the university's professional schools, including Law, Education and Social Work, it will
fill an identifiable need and equip graduates to respond to the increasingly complex
human rights challenges.

Respectually submitted,

176

To Whom It May Concern:
This Jetter is in support of the proposed Master of Human Rights (MHR) at the

I have an M.A. in Human Rights from the University of Essex in Colchester, U.k,
which 1 received in 1999.

,

Since this time, due to the opportunities this degree afforded, I have worked as a
Human Rights Officer with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) with their mission in Kosovo; as a lecturer with the Norman Paterson School
of International Affairs (NPS1A) at Carleton University, and as a Program Advisor in
the Humanitarian Affairs Division with the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA). As welJ, for several years I was an employee of a special UN human
rights and humanitarian roster consisting of UNICEF (UN Children's Fund), UNHCR,
(UN High Commissioner for Refugees), OHCHR (UN Office of the High Commissioner
for Human .Rights) and OCHA (tJN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs). As a 'Senior Protection Officer' I was deployed to the field by 1 of these 4
agencies depending on need.
For the past several years I have been a consultant in the area of human rights.
Contracts have included Amnesty International, UNDP (UN Development Program),
and IOM (lnternational Organization for Migration).
As someone who had to study abroad to obtain a degree similar to the one being
proposed by U of M because none existed in Canada, it would have been a great help
to have had access to a program like this when I was looking for graduate programs.
As such, I think the proposed MHR will be filling a much needed niche in Canada and
will attract a broad array of students who are looking for an opportunity to gain
academic knowledge in an area that would provide them with opportunities to work
either in Canada with non-profits or the federal or provincial governments, or
abroad with multi-lateral agencies, such as the UN or OSCE or international nongovernmental organizations.

Dear Dr. Barnard:
Re:

LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR MASTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRAMME AT
UNIVERSITY OF MANITOBA

The Manitoba Human Rfghts Commission is delighted to hear that lhe University of Manitoba is
considering a Master of Human Rights programme.
Since the United Nations adopted The Decfaration for Human Rights In 19481 human rights
have held an Important place in th.e legal and polltlcal frameworks of modern societies. Despite
the formal recognttlon of human rights and various systems to promote and protect those rights,
discrimination continues to exist across CQnada, including Manitoba, Human rights cannot be
left solely to commissions, tribunals, and courts. It requires the engagement of a wider public In
a critical discourse about the effect of stereotype and prejudice, Its causes, and potential
rer.,,edies. While human rights commissions actively work to educate the public 1 such an
objective also requires input of bright Innovators and researchers.
The Commission believes that a programme such es the proposed Master of Human Rights at
the University of Manitoba would equip human rights innovators and researchers tc lead
meaningful change in local, national, and international communities. The Commission strongly
encourages the University of Manitoba to consider lmplementlng such ~ programme given the
c]e13r need.
The Commission would be pleased to work with the University In relation to such a programme,
exploring possibilities for involvement with the programme In areas such as research projects
for students, thesis committee membership, involvement with events, and guest lectures.
Sincerely

Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2
Dear Dr. Barnard:
On behalf of the Manitoba Council for International Cooperation, I am pleased to
write a letter of support for the Master of Human Rights program.
I think this would be a significant opportunity for Manitoba and the University of
Manitoba to offer a Master's level program in Human Rights. Manitoba has often
been at the forefront of important milestones in Human Rights, such as Manitoba
women getting the right to vote, the Disability Rights Movement, and now with the
opening of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, it makes sense for Manitoba to
lead the way in offering a Master in Human Rights.
In recent years MCIC's programming in international development has moved
toward a rights based approach to development. I think the international
development sector would value from the contribution of graduates of a MHR
program.

In conclusion, I fully support the development of a Master in Human Rights program
at the University of Manitoba. The Inter-disciplinary and trans-faculty engagement
that is being proposed is exciting. I think this program could play an important role
in building a more just and fair world for all.
Sincerely,

Dear President Barnard;

I am very pleased that a graduate program proposal for the establishment of a Master of Human Rights
(MHR) program at the University of Manitoba has been developed.
As you may know, I have endeavored to advance the understanding and practice of human rights
throughout most of my life. It seems to me the MHR program will not only complement other academic
programs at the University of Manitoba and other institutions of higher academic learning in the
province, it will also provide a centerpiece for leadership and further coherent development of human
rights learning infrastructures. Human rights expertise should, and must, be welcomed and employed in
every public and private enterprise. This could, and will, advance us toward our shared vision of a future
where human rights are pervasively manifest.
Such a future cannot arrive by directive only from above; it is achieved by shared, collective efforts by
ma ny at every level. On my part, I am willing to contribute to the development and operation of the
MHR program. As an example, perhaps I ca n help by providing guest lectures in fieldwork, or any other
appropriate course in the program.
Thank you for your consideration.
Yours truly,
Dr. Jim Derksen

Dear Dr. Barnard,
We are pleased to support the application of the Centre for Human Rights Research to create a new interdisciplinary Master of Human Rights degree.
Winnipeg Harvest believes strongly that such a program will support the development of increased consciousness of the Importance of human rights in Winnipeg, Manitoba and Canada.
You are likely to attract students who put a high value on human rights, in practice as well as theory.
They could find careers In a wide variety of fields, including human rights commissions, governments, teaching
and non-governmental organizations.
Winnipeg Harvest would be pleased to consider co-operation with this program on a number of fronts. We would
be prepared to have student placements at Winnipeg Harvest, just as we do with the College of Nursing.
We could hold Jointly sponsored events with the MHR program. ~or instance, three years ago, Winnipeg Harvest
sponsored a workshop with two U of M professors, Evelyn Forget and Wayne Simpson, on the Manitoba Minimum Income program.
We could provide a guest lecture for the fieldwork course, as we do with the College of Medicine.
Winnipeg Harvest could be a potential employer of graduates of this program, just as we currently employ a
number of U of M grads from different faculties, including Fine Arts.
Winnipeg Harvest believes that the right to food - the right to be free from hunger- is a basic human right. We
look forward to working with the Faculty members, staff and students to explore what that truth means in Canada
today ,and in the future.
We are selfish in our support, because we see the need to engage and provide actions with human rights promises that can help us reduce the need for food banks in Canada.
This program can help to give us hope.
Please let me 'know if we can provide any additional support for this worthy application.

Proposed Master of Human Rights – Review Committee Assessment
For the University of Manitoba
Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, Ph.D., FRSC, Canada Research Chair in International Human
Rights, Wilfrid Laurier University and Balsillie School of International Affairs
John Packer, LLM, Director of the Human Rights Research and Education Centre and Associate
Professor of Law, University of Ottawa
February 9, 2016

We would like to thank the University of Manitoba for inviting us to review its proposal for a
Master of Human Rights (MHR). We would also like to thank those many individuals and
administrators who prepared the application and arranged our visit, and who took the time to
meet with us during our two-day visit on February 1 and 2, 2016.
A. Recommendation to Establish the Proposed Program
Our overall assessment of this proposed degree is positive; indeed, we consider it to be
trailblazing. Below, we list the reasons for this positive assessment.
1. Canada needs such a program, which will be the first and only one in the country. It is
important and timely and stands to help put UM on the map, nationally and internationally. At
the moment, Canadians wishing to attain a non-law master’s degree in human rights must travel
abroad, mostly to the United States or United Kingdom (where approximately 40 programs of
this kind already exist). Thus, UM is likely to attract students from all over Canada to this
innovative interdisciplinary degree, which will both draw on and strengthen some of UM’s
existing programs. Several undergraduate programs in human rights and/or social justice exist
across Canada, but there is nowhere in the country where professors in these programs could
advise their students to go for graduate training.
2. The MHR is consistent with UM’s strategic plan, which includes human rights as one of its six
strategic priorities. It is also a very good fit with the city of Winnipeg where, according to the
proposal, “a coalition of local organizations is working on a plan to have Winnipeg emerge as a
leading city for human rights education.” Similarly, it reflects Winnipeg’s and Manitoba’s
history of social justice, progressive public policy and governance.
3. UM possesses a significant comparative advantage in offering this program. It has close
associations with the Canadian Museum for Human Rights and is the location of the National
Centre for Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR) – both specifically committed to the MHR.

187

4. UM’s connections with and concern for indigenous Canadians will make the proposed MHR
very attractive to students. Many individuals and faculties (e.g. law, education, social work) at
UM are already actively engaged in practical work with indigenous Canadians. This particular
concern might be very attractive to international students, for example from Europe, who are
interested in the rights of indigenous peoples, a growing area of interest.
5. The MHR might also be attractive to those interested in the human rights of persons with
disabilities, given that NGOs in Winnipeg were instrumental in formulating the Convention on
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The presence of a dedicated postgraduate program on
Disabilities Studies and proximity in Winnipeg to the Manitoba League of Persons with
Disabilities, the Council of Canadians with Disabilities, and the Canadian Centre on Disability
Studies combine to offer a critical mass of expert resources in this increasingly important field.
6. Representatives from the Faculty of Law also suggested that the MHR might broaden the base
of their own students and so enrich their learning environment.

B. Recommended Changes in the Proposed Program
Despite our enthusiastic endorsement of the proposed degree, we recommend that, without in
any way undermining its scholarly and critical rigour, the MHR be focused on a more
professional and applied orientation. By this we mean the following changes, which we elaborate
below in our answers to specific questions.
1. Elimination of the heavy thesis requirement – replacing the long thesis requirement by a
standard research paper.
2. Move to a 12 or 16-month program from proposed 24-month program.
3. Strong grounding in knowledge of international law and systems for the protection of
human rights (including universal, regional and domestic levels).
4. Training in different types of professional skills, notably writing.
5. Practicum and/or internship (international strongly recommended).
6. Second-language requirement strongly recommended.
7. Addition of further courses (notably, environment, business ethics, human security).
8. Hiring a new professor who can teach both research methods in human rights (as per the
proposal) and a course on the international, regional, and domestic systems for the
protection of human rights.

188

C. Answers to Specific Questions Posed by the Letter to Assessors (Note: some of the
answers below repeat information already in Sections A and B above)
Comparison with related programs
As noted above, there is no other interdisciplinary master’s in human rights program in Canada.
Currently, Canadian students must travel abroad to pursue a master’s in this field, imposing
heavy financial costs. The proposed UM degree might therefore draw not only students from
Winnipeg and Manitoba, but also from all of Canada. The degree might also prove to be a draw
for foreign students, as the cost would be significantly lower than in the US or UK.
The proposed MHR is competitive with other masters-level programs in this field of which we
are aware. There is a substantial body of experienced researchers in human rights or related areas
at UM, and a very broad range of course offerings in the field.
The proposed MHR might be very attractive for early or mid-career professionals in human
rights-related areas seeking educational upgrades or qualifications. For such persons, it would
probably be much more attractive if its duration were 12 or 16 months rather than two years. For
those with professional experience, the proposed requirement of a four-month practicum could
be waived, so that their commitment would be for only one year.
However, other master’s degrees in human rights are usually thoroughly grounded in
international relations and international law, including knowledge of systems and institutions of
human rights. The best of them also normally include some practical experience and promote
acquisition of skills and competencies including multilingualism, preferably acquisition of a
second (or even third, fourth or more) language. We recommend that UM follow this model as
much as possible.
Breadth and Depth of Curriculum
While the breadth of courses listed as options for students to take is impressive, we are
nevertheless concerned about some significant gaps.
We are particularly concerned that students be familiar not only with the international, regional
and domestic laws of human rights, but also with the international, regional, and domestic
organizations and systems that are mandated to protect human rights through supervisory bodies
and available judicial and non-judicial recourses. Indeed, the effective implementation and
realization of human rights is increasingly being achieved through non-traditional organisations
and institutions such as the World Bank and the World Trade Organization. The range and
number of institutions and actors at the domestic level is also increasing. Thus, we believe that
the new hire should be able to teach a course in this area, and that this course should be
compulsory.

189

4

If the MHR includes a compulsory course on human rights organizations and systems, however,
that would mean that it would require four compulsory courses in all, leaving only two optional
courses. We believe that it is crucial for students to obtain the kind of background that potential
employers would expect; thus this change in requirements is justifiable.
We recommend that courses related to the human right to a clean environment be included as
options. This is a growing field in human rights and one that relates to climate change; some
students might wish to pursue this field as a specialization.
We are concerned that there do not appear to be any offerings from the School of Business or the
Department of Economics. Growing areas of concern in international human rights include
matters of financial resource collection and use notably in respect of social and economic rights,
the role of private actors including for-profit corporate entities, and thus corporate social
responsibility (CSR): CSR pertains in particular to Canada’s very large extractive industries
(mining, logging, etc.) sector. If, as the proposal for the MHR suggests, its students are to be
prepared to work as human rights advisors in the corporate sector, then they must be familiar
with the latest thinking in CSR and with business ethics in general.
We hope that HMRT7100 “Theory & Practice of HR: Critical Perspectives,” which we assume
will be a required course, will include some basic grounding in the philosophy of human rights,
especially knowledge of Enlightenment philosophy. We also recommend that this course be
renamed to remove its promise of “Practice;” the latter should be delivered through dedicated
skills elements and a practicum.
We suggest that the proposed optional seminar in professional socialization be made compulsory
but non-credit. This seminar should be used to teach professional skills, especially in forms of
writing other than academic, such as how to write policy briefs, legislation, and fact-finding
reports, fund-raising proposals, and reports for NGOs; how to use traditional media such as
writing op-eds; and how to use new forms of social media such as blogs, Facebook and Twitter
for advocacy work. The seminar should also teach negotiation skills, in line with the description
of the MHR (B-1). Finally, it could also be used to teach academic skills such as how to present
at conferences, how to prepare a research grant proposal, and how to write a paper for
publication.
As noted above, we recommend that the new assistant professor in human rights should teach a
course on the international human rights system as well as a course on human rights research
methods. We are assured by the Faculty of Law that several of its professors can offer the
necessary course on international human rights law, and we also understand that at least two
professors can teach the course currently entitled Human Rights Theory and Practice.

190

5

Demand for Graduates
We believe there will be significant demand for graduates from the proposed program, especially
if the key changes we suggest; namely, inclusion of a required practicum or internship, and
inclusion of a second-language requirement, are instituted.
In the public sector, there will be demands from national, regional and municipal governments,
as well as human rights commissions and similar bodies at various levels. There will also be
demand from intergovernmental organizations (not only from the United Nations and its
affiliated organizations, but also from international financial institutions and regional human
rights organizations).
Arguably greater opportunities for employment will arise from the burgeoning “third sector” of
non-governmental organizations, civil society and community-based organizations. These
entities increasingly require new hires in principal positions to possess Masters-level education
in the field of human rights and social justice (as well as proficiency in more than one language).
Private research foundations, think-tanks and think-and-do-tanks of various kinds might also be
interested in hiring graduates.
Private corporations also hire human rights advisors and many more are likely to do so in the
future, but they will probably require some knowledge of business ethics as well as a minimal
understanding of economics.
In Professor Packer’s experience, students with interdisciplinary degrees in human rights are as
likely to be employed as students with Masters of Laws degrees. This is likely to be increasingly
so.
Excellence of faculty and breadth of expertise
While we were not in a position to assess the qualifications of individual faculty members, we
were very favourably impressed by the range of faculty interests. The breadth of fields covered is
substantial, and more than enough to satisfy the degree requirements, except for the key course
on the international system, as noted above. Many widely published UM scholars, enjoying the
recognition and esteem of their peers, appear committed to contribute the proposed program.
This will prove a strength for the program as a whole (and possibly spawn valuable
interdisciplinary research collaborations and new courses ahead).
There are also several centres and institutes at UM that have solid memberships, established
teaching programs and research outputs, as well as exciting outreach activities. These include the
Centre for Human Rights Research (which has already established the Canadian Journal of
Human Rights,) the Mauro Centre for Peace and Justice and the NCTR. Thus, there is an exciting
group of research centres at UM, making it a fertile environment within which to locate the
MHR.

191

6

Adequacy of facilities, space and other resources
The proposed location of the MHR in St. Paul’s College is an excellent choice, assuming that St.
Paul’s will be renovated (as foreseen) including to be fully accessible. We recommend that in the
new study areas students be provided with secure, lockable cubicles or drawers, so that they do
not have to worry about leaving their own property and/or confidential documents in their
research spaces. We applaud St. Paul’s proposal to build nearby a post-graduate, culturally
sensitive residence for international students.
The co-location with the program on Peace and Conflict Studies and the proximity to Disability
Studies (once the latter is able to move) will yield important synergies of both a substantive and
practical nature with faculty and students in these programs.
The library has assured the university that it can support this program, and we agree with its
assessment. The existence of a dedicated library in St. Paul’s College available to MHR students
is an additional asset.
We note however the need for sufficient administrative support, notably for the non-credit but
compulsory skills course that we propose, and for organization of practicums or internships.
While we understand that at the moment the proposal is to have one full-time administrative
assistant, we suggest another half-time position to help with the practicums and/or internships,
which will be especially important in the initial years when placement relationships will need to
be established.
It is important, moreover, that the program not be underfunded; rather, the university should take
a bold approach. We suggest that the eight $2500 scholarships currently proposed for research
should also be available for internships. Moreover, we suggest that fund-raisers be instructed to
seek support at the level of $5,000 each for each year’s annual intake of 15 students to pursue
practicums or internships. There should also be funds made available for invited guest lecturers
and other events in order to enrich the program and assure the highest quality which would be
competitive with leading, established programs in the world.
In this last respect, we were encouraged by the enthusiastic assessment of UM’s fund-raising
officer about the prospect of meeting the fund-raising goal for the new MHR, especially if it
were more practice-oriented.
In sum, a high quality professionally-oriented program that is fully nationally and internationally
attractive and yields candidates for a range of employment opportunities should be properly
funded. Reputation-building will be vital; thus the program should not be hamstrung from the
start.

192

Strengths and Weaknesses of the Program Proposal
We have documented the many strengths of the proposed MHR above, and suggested ways to
strengthen it.
With regard to weaknesses, we reiterate that there is no need for a heavy thesis requirement in
this degree, either for those students aspiring to enter or re-enter a professional career in human
rights, or for those aspiring to become academics. Indeed, we believe such a requirement would
be unnecessary and make the MHR less attractive to applicants, compared with other programs
in the world. Rather, we suggest the MHR stress experiential learning and practical skills,
especially writing skills. We suggest that the program be reduced to three or four terms (12 or 16
months) depending on whether a practicum is included: this would include two terms of courses,
one term for a practicum, and one term to write a short, possibly publishable thesis.
A research paper of 7,500-10,000 words, for which the standard would be that it was of a quality
high enough to be submitted to an academic journal, is more practical, would take less time, and
might, if actually accepted by a journal, improve the chances of those graduates wishing to
pursue a Ph.D.
A practical advantage of this change in requirements would be that far fewer supervisory
resources would be required: one professor could supervise and one could act as second reader,
with no need for an oral defense either of the thesis proposal or the finished product. Several
individuals to whom we spoke voiced their concerns that, as proposed, the MHR would require
supervisory time from faculty members already heavily committed in this regard.
We also encourage introduction of a second-language requirement in the program. As currently
proposed, a second language is required only if necessary for the research thesis. We propose
that if a second language is not required for the research paper, the student nevertheless should
show competence in a language other than English. Some incoming students will already
possess such competence. If not, they should be encouraged to gain competence in a “world
language”; hence, we propose acquisition of one of the United Nations’ official languages (that
is, in addition to English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, or Russian) or another world
language such as German.
Overall Assessment
We recommend that UM proceed to institute an MHR with the modifications that we have
suggested. The program should not start before all elements are in place and the required funds

Report of the Faculty Council of Graduate Studies on Program and Curriculum Changes

Preamble:
1.

The Faculty of Graduate Studies has responsibility for all matters relating to the submission of
graduate course, curriculum and program changes. Recommendations for new programs or
changes are submitted by the Faculty Council of Graduate Studies for the approval of Senate.

2.

The Faculty Council of Graduate Studies met on February 17, 2017 to consider a proposal
from the Dept. of Agribusiness & Agricultural Economics.

Observations
1.

The Dept. of Agribusiness and Agricultural Economics proposes the introduction of three
program streams in the Master’s program.
The Department of Agribusiness and Agricultural Economics offers graduate instruction leading
to the M.Sc. degree, including three streams as described below. The Ph.D. program is offered
through the Department of Economics, with students electing an Agricultural Economics field of
specialization. The purpose of graduate training in Agribusiness and Agricultural Economics is
to develop competence in solving real world problems relating to food production, policy, risk
management, marketing, finance, international trade, resources, international development,
agribusiness management, and the environment.
Students undertaking MSc graduate studies in Agribusiness and Agricultural Economics will
specialize in one of three streams (see below) and it is requested that the selected streams will
be recorded on the student’s transcript.
M.Sc. Program Requirements
The M.Sc. program has three streams: (1) Agricultural Economics, (2) Agribusiness and (3)
Environmental and Resource Economics, and a student will choose one of these three streams.
Within each stream, there is a thesis option and a comprehensive option. In each of these three
streams, the thesis option includes 18 credit hours (with at least 9 credit hours at 7000 level)
and the comprehensive option includes 27 credit hours (with at least 18 credit hours at 7000
level). Other course work will normally be at 7000 level as well.
All students in the thesis option must complete a thesis and pass an oral examination based
primarily on the thesis. These students must present two graduate seminars open to the public.
The first presentation shall be on the thesis proposal paper, and the second presentation will be
on the completed research.
All students in the comprehensive option must complete a research paper and pass an oral
examination based primarily on the paper. These students shall present at a graduate seminar
open to the public and be based on the completed research.

February 17, 2017
Report of the Faculty Council of Graduate Studies on Program and Curriculum Changes

Students will have a permanent or temporary advisor upon entering the program, and all
students must have a permanent advisor by the second term. New students will typically
declare their stream at the beginning of their program, and must declare their stream by the
second term. If existing students elect the three stream option, they will declare their stream at
that time.
Students will obtain approval from their advisor for their stream of interest, and if their stream of
interest is Agribusiness or Environmental and Resources Economics, then DGAC (Department
Graduate Advisory Committee) must approve it. (Otherwise, the student will take the
Agricultural Economics stream).
Students will obtain approval for any change in stream from their advisor, and if their new
stream of interest is Agribusiness or Environmental and Resources Economics, then DGAC
(Department Graduate Advisory Committee) must approve it. Both the thesis and
comprehensive paper must be in the area of the student’s selected stream.
Requirements Specific to the Three MSc Streams:
Within the above program requirements (18 credit hours for thesis option, 27 credit hours for
comprehensive option), students must include the following courses specific to their selected
stream.
1. Agricultural Economics Stream: All Students in Agricultural Economics stream (both
thesis and comprehensive option) must include the following courses within their program:
a. Microeconomics:
ABIZ 7940 and ABIZ 7950
OR
ECON 7722

6 credit hours
3 credit hours

b. Quantitative Methods
3 credit hours
(a course in Econometrics, Management Science, or Statistics, as approved by advisor,
normally at 7000 level)
2.
Agribusiness Stream: All students in the Agribusiness stream (both thesis and
comprehensive option) must include the following courses within their program:
a. ABIZ 7410 Agricultural Finance

3 credit hours

b. an additional 6 credit hours in agribusiness or related area
(as approved by advisor, normally at 7000 level)

6 credit hours

c. Quantitative Methods
3 credit hours
(a course in Econometrics, Management Science, or Statistics, as approved by advisor,
normally at 7000 level)

Report of the Faculty Council of Graduate Studies on Program and Curriculum Changes

Note: A limited number of students will be given permission to take the Agribusiness stream,
based on department capacity. (Not all professors in the department specialize in this stream,
so this may limit the number of students who can be supervised in this area).
3. Environmental and Resource Economics Stream: All Students in Environmental and
Resource Economics stream (both thesis and comprehensive option) must include the following
courses within their program:
a. Microeconomics:
ABIZ 7940 and ABIZ 7950
OR
ECON 7722

6 credits
3 credits

b. Quantitative Methods
3 credits
(a course in Econometrics, Management Science, or Statistics, as approved by advisor,

2.

The Faculty Council of Graduate Studies met on February 17, 2017 to consider a proposal
from the Asper School of Business.

Observations
1. The Asper School of Business MBA program proposes an adjustment to its IELTS score
requirement.
The MBA program language score required is an IELTS 7 with no score less than 5 in any
band. It is proposed that the IELTS score of 7 have no band score less than 6.
Bands refer to reading, writing, listening and speaking. The maximum score per band is 9. To
achieve the required total score of 7 students generally need to get a score of 6 or more in
any band. Scores of 5 mean that students are functioning at the 55% level. Functioning at
55% in any one band is not adequate to meet the language level required by students in the
MBA program.
Since students must achieve a 6 or better in any band to achieve the overall score of 7, it
seems incongruous to have a minimum level of 5. Further, if a student does score a 5 or 5.5 in
a band but still achieves an overall score of 7 it means they are particularly poor in one aspect
of language which may prove to be a significant disadvantage for that student in class, in
group and individual assignments. ‘
Student entrance data from the past two years was reviewed by the Asper School MBA
program Director and this change will have little impact on enrolment. It will only prevent
students that are especially low in one particular area from being accepted into the program.
Recommendations
The Faculty Council of Graduate Studies recommends THAT: the program changes from the
unit listed below be approved by Senate:
Asper School of Business

2.

The Faculty Council of Graduate Studies met on February 17, 2017 to consider a proposal
from the Dept. of Computer Science.

Observations

1.

The Dept. of Computer Science proposes the elimination of its CanTEST supplemental
regulation requirement and to adhere to FGS English language proficiency requirements.
Historically, the CanTEST was required of all students within their first year of registration in
the department.
The Department of Computer Science supplementary regulations currently include a
requirement that graduate students in Computer Science complete the CanTEST during the
first year of their program. The CanTEST is an English language proficiency exam, similar to
TOEFL. The proposed change is to remove this requirement and to maintain the FGS English
language proficiency requirements. Motivation for removing this requirement includes the
following:








The removal of the requirement was recommended by the recent external review of the
Department of Computer Science’s graduate program.
The requirement is redundant given the FGS requirement for English language proficiency.
The timing of the test was ineffective, since students could take the test as late as one
year into the program. A student’s English language proficiency must be known before
being admitted to the program, not one year after entering the program.
The additional test did not lead to increased English language proficiency in the
department’s graduate students.
The test caused added administrative work and costs for the department and for students.
The existing FGS application requirements are sufficient to evaluate English
language proficiency in applicants to the graduate program.

The proposed change will not result in any increased costs; it will both save money by
eliminating the fee for the test, and allow students—whose language skills have already been
verified by the more stringent FGS requirements—to focus on their classes and research.

2.

The Faculty Council of Graduate Studies met on February 17, 2017 to consider a proposal
from the Dept. of Curriculum, Teaching & Learning.

Observations
1.

The Dept. of Curriculum, Teaching & Learning proposes changes to its “Studies in
Curriculum, Teaching and Learning” M. Ed. Program Specialization.
Professors and students in the Dept. of Curriculum, Teaching & Learning have asked for
more flexibility and increased choice within the general curriculum core courses. In addition,
there is agreement among professors that there are core areas of general curriculum studies
(e.g., assessment and evaluation; curriculum leadership) that are not adequately represented
within the current course offerings. Plans are underway to plan such advanced courses and
pilot them under the EDUB 7142 Topics in Curriculum, Teaching, and Learning course with
an aim to bring some new courses forward for permanent offering. Furthermore, the
department has another general curriculum course (EDUB 7330) that could be part of this
group of general curriculum courses and currently is not. Offering a larger palette of general
curriculum courses is also part of the department’s action planning linked to the last external
M. Ed. Program Review which allows the department to: a) increase access to courses, b)
facilitate time to completion through alternative routes to meet core requirements, c) increase
relevance of course content, d) increase ability to meet needs of students, and e) augment
the department’s ability to respond to cohort requests.
There is no impact on resources associated with these revisions.

The Faculty Council of Graduate Studies met on February 17, 2017 to consider a proposal
from the Dept. of Landscape Architecture.

Observations

1.

The Dept. of Landscape Architecture proposes an increase in its required IELTS English
language test score and an update to its supplemental regulations stating which English
language test scores the department does not accept.
The current Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA) supplemental regulations require a
TOEFL score of 580, which is equivalent to an IELTS score of 6.5 to 7.0. The department
therefore seeks to amend the MLA program regulations such that incoming students using the
IELTS to demonstrate their English-language proficiency have to attain the higher IELTS level
of 7.0.
The department would also like to restrict measurement of English-language proficiency to the
CanTEST (if required) and, as a matter of course, the TOEFL or the IELTS. These are the test
results that the department most frequently receives; they appear, over time, to have been an
accurate reflection of students’ English-language proficiency; it is administratively far simpler to
restrict applicants to these tried and tested measures.
Corresponding revisions to Section 1.1 .7 of the MLA Supplemental Regulations are as follows:
Applicants whose first language is not English may be required, by the Head of
department, to submit scores for the CanTEST. In making offers of admission to
applicants, preference will be given to applicants with TOEFL scores above 580
(paperbased), 237 (computer based), 94 (internet based) or with IELTS scores at or above
7.0. The Department does not accept the results of MELAB, AEPUCE, CAEL or PTE
Academic tests as evidence of acceptable English-language proficiency.

The Faculty Council of Graduate Studies met on February 17, 2017 to consider a proposal
from the Dept. of Occupational Therapy.

Observations

1.

The Dept. of Occupational Therapy proposes revisions to the English Language
Requirement for the Master of Occupational Therapy (MOT) program. These changes would
involve no longer accepting four currently accepted tests and raising the minimum scores for
three.
Background:
 The English Language requirements for the MOT program were set to align with the
Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) minimum requirements for the first MOT intake in
2003.
 The admissions committee recognizes that the MOT program at the University of
Manitoba is a linguistically demanding academic program; the minimum language
requirements need to reflect that it is a full-time program with significant language
demands.
 The MOT program would like to align with other English speaking OT programs in Canada
(University of British Columbia, University of Alberta, University of Toronto, Western
University, Queen’s, McMaster, McGill, Dalhousie) regarding the tests accepted and the
minimum scores required.
 There is general agreement within the admissions committee and with the provincial
regulatory body, the College of Occupational Therapists of Manitoba (COTM), that the
language requirements to study in an occupational therapy education program be higher
than those required to practice.
Process:
To help guide the decision making regarding changes to the English Language Requirements,
the followed were reviewed:
 Standards from COTM for internationally trained occupational therapists (which are based
on the Association of Canadian Occupational Therapy Regulatory Organizations).
 Requirements across the country for other OT programs (including email discussions from
3 universities re: rationale for scores)
 Scoring interpretation for TOEFL, CanTest, and IELTS
Discussion also occurred with the FGS Student Admissions Officer regarding frequency of
submissions of tests.

The Faculty Council of Graduate Studies met on February 17, 2017 to consider a proposal
from the Dept. of Sociology.

Observations

1.

The Dept. of Sociology proposes supplementary regulation changes including changes to its
English language proficiency scores, Indigenous Achievement admission consideration, and
Ph.D. program requirements.
a) The Department of Sociology proposes the following additional wording to the Masters and
Ph.D. English Language Proficiency (ELP) (and specifically in sections 1.1.7 and 5.1.5) of
its supplemental regulations:
The Department of Sociology uses all ELP test score minimums as stipulated by the
Faculty of Graduate studies with the following exceptions:
 IELTS: the minimum score must be 6.5 in each of test bands
 TOEFL: minimum thresholds must be 600 on the paper test and 100 overall on
the internet- based test (with a minimum speaking/writing of 22).
Rationale: Some EAL students who have been admitted in recent years have experienced
great difficulty writing in English, which has involved excess work on the part of instructors
and their advisors. The university currently does not have sufficient supports in place to
assist EAL students with writing, and therefore the Department has decided to raise the
IELTS and TOEFL scores. These revisions are in response to the Cycle #2 Graduate
Program Review of the Department of Sociology (2016).
There are no resource implications for Sociology, but there are for the university. With the
increase in International Student enrolment there is a greater need for EAL support in terms
of academic writing, as well as oral communication.
b) The Department of Sociology proposes the following additional wording to the Masters
Admission criteria (section 4.3.1) of its supplemental regulations:
Applications from students who self-identify as Indigenous or Aboriginal including (First
Nations, Métis, Inuit) will be reviewed to determine whether special admission
1

209

February 17, 2017
Report of the Faculty Council of Graduate Studies on Program and Curriculum Changes

consideration is warranted incases where the GPA falls below minimum entry requirements
and the letters of reference and statement of intent are particularly strong. This
consideration is in accordance with the university’s mandate as stated on the ‘Indigenous
Connect’ webpage at http://umanitoba.ca/admin/indigenous_connect/3388.html
The University of Manitoba is committed to Indigenous Achievement and to ensuring the
success of First Nations, Métis and Inuit students and graduates. We are dedicated to
making the University of Manitoba a place where all Indigenous students have a home.
The University of Manitoba will work with a variety of partners to make Manitoba the
national centre for Indigenous education and research and in particular to allow First
Nation, Métis and Inuit students to be prepared for and to achieve education Nation, Métis
and Inuit students to be prepared for and to achieve education success in the full range of
academic programs we offer.
Rationale: The Graduate Committee currently assesses Aboriginal applicants who are not
admissible but are very close to meeting all criteria on a case-by-case basis. This change is a
formal statement of what is already in practice. In keeping with the University’s mandate the
Department wishes to make a formal statement 1) to acknowledge Indigenous peoples; and
2) as a gesture of Affirmative Action. Moreover, in response to Sociology’s Cycle #2 Graduate
Program Review the Department is developing more consistent criteria and procedures for
graduate admissions and recruitment.
There are no resource implications for this change at this time.
c) The Department of Sociology proposes the following additional wording to the Ph.D.
Program Requirements (section 5.4) of its supplemental regulations:
All students must complete at least 3 credit hours in theory (i.e., one of: SOC 7190, SOC
7320, SOC 7430, SOC 7440, SOC 7480) and 6 credit hours in research methods (i.e.,
two of SOC 7400, SOC 7390, SOC 7420). Students must achieve a minimum grade of
‘B' in each of the two research methods courses. With permission from the Graduate
Chair, students may replace one research methods course offered by the Department of
Sociology with a graduate-level research methods course from outside the department.
Rationale: Previously students were required to take one quantitative methods course and
one qualitative methods course. Due to the cycling of methods courses and the restriction this
requirement posed to students, the Graduate Committee and Department Council has
changed the requirement to any two methods courses. Also, SOC 7410 has been deleted.
These revisions are not in response to a program review or for accreditation. This change
reflects the current reality of course offerings. There are no resource implications for this
change.

program.
These three courses are already being offered in the MSW-Indigenous Knowledges (MSW-IK)
program currently being offered as of September 2016. The funding to establish the MSW-IK
included funding for two full time faculty members and two full time teaching elders as well as
student advising and administrative support including a part-time program director. The
intention of this funding was also to enhance further Indigenization of other parts of our
Masters level education in Social Work. To that end we are proposing the Indigenous Practice
cluster in our MSW program.
The MSW Program currently consists of four clusters or specializations from which each
applicant must choose one. These include: Direct Practice with Individuals and Families; Direct
Practice with Groups, Networks, and Communities; Leadership, Management and Policy; and
Social Work Research. This proposal adds one more cluster from which applicants can
choose: Indigenous Practice.
All students in the MSW program must complete 9 credit hours of core content (3 courses), 9
credit hours from their chosen cluster (3 courses), 6 credit hours of elective courses (2
courses), and either a thesis or an Advanced Placement (SWRK 7180 and 7190).

Report of the Faculty Council of Graduate Studies on Program and Curriculum Changes

The MSW-IK is an alternate route to an MSW degree based on completion of 13 required
courses and a thesis or Advanced Placement/Project (SWRK 7180 and SWRK 7190). This
program is an option for Social Workers who wish a graduate degree program embedded in
Indigenous Knowledges delivered by both professors and traditional elders jointly influenced by
critical theory in Social Work and traditional Indigenous approaches to leadership and healing.
It is the preferred option for some Social Workers working with Indigenous people and
organizations, but not all.
The Indigenous Practice cluster will provide another graduate option for Social Workers
working with Indigenous people and organizations who would prefer some degree of
Indigenization and a program based in critical theory, offering the core MSW courses and 6
credit hours of electives as well as the thesis or Advanced Placement option. The cluster
incorporates three out of the 13 courses of the MSW-IK. All of these courses will be led
primarily by the professors hired for the program but also include some input from the elders.
The students in the Indigenous Practice cluster will take each of these courses along with the
students in the MSW-IK program. Incorporating these students into these three MSW-IK
courses was built into the planning of the MSW-IK program and Indigenous Practice cluster of
the MSW program.

Report of the Faculty Council of Graduate Studies on Regulation Changes

Preamble
1. The Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) has responsibility for all matters relating to policy changes
and the revising of the FGS Academic Guide. Recommendations for academic changes are
submitted by the Faculty Council of Graduate Studies for the approval of Senate.
2. The Faculty Council of Graduate Studies met on the above date to consider the draft 2017/18
Academic Guide.

Observations

1.

The Faculty of Graduate Studies proposes changes to the Academic Guide for 2017/18.
The changes to the academic guide consist primarily of housekeeping matters and clearly
defining the language in sections. More substantive changes are as follows:













Section 1.5: Update of Student Accessibility links
Section 2.2: Faculty of Graduate Studies’ BFAR added to section 2 (previously Senate
approved)
Section 2.3: Progress Reports cannot be submitted more than once per term
Section 2.5: Pre-Master’s students will now be required to complete GRAD 7500
Section 2.5: GRAD 7500 is now required of all students within their first term of registration
(previously Senate approved)
Sections 4.5 & 5.2.2: Clearly stating that Master’s and Ph.D. students may not have more
than one (1) co-advisor
Section 4.8.1.2: Master’s examining committee appointment form must be approved by the
Dean of Graduate Studies at least two weeks prior to the distribution of the thesis
Section 5.1.3: A recommendation from the unit for a student to transfer from the Masters to
the Ph.D. must now be received by the Faculty of Graduate Studies at least four (4) terms
from the start of the student’s Master’s program (previously this was 18 months)
Section 5.2.1: Clearly defining that M.D., D.M.D. and J.D. are undergraduate degrees
which are not equivalent graduate degrees (previously this was considered on a case-bycase basis)
Section 5.11.1: Specifically stating that all members of the Ph.D. advisory committee are
expected to serve on the examining committee and that one member must hold an
appointment (no longer primary appointment) within the unit and one member must hold no
appointment within the unit
Section 5.11.6: Clearly stating that it is the joint responsibility of the Ph.D. advisor/coadvisor and student to provide all internal committee members with a copy of the revised
thesis along with a written and detailed summary of all significant revisions made to the
thesis well in advance of the oral defence.

214

Section 5.11.6: Clearly stating that if the Ph.D. external examiner fails the thesis, the unit
Head will provide a detailed written remediation plan to the advisor/co-advisor, the
candidate and the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Section 5.12.5: Clearly stating that in the case of a first failure of the Ph.D. oral defence,
the candidate will have the opportunity to discuss the report with the internal examining
committee. If the thesis is revised, then it is strongly recommended that the candidate
circulate it to the members of the internal examining committee and obtain their informal
approval to proceed to a second distribution before doing so. A new copy of the thesis
should be submitted directly to the Faculty of Graduate Studies for distribution to the
external examiner and examining committee within 3 months of the failed oral examination,
in preparation for a second and final oral examination. The candidate is already deemed to
have passed the thesis (Section 5.11.6); however, the examination during the oral defence
shall be based on the revised document.
Section 9.6: Updating the Discipline Appeals section to reflect the University’s Academic
and Non-Academic Misconduct Policies

Please see version showing tracked changes and version with tracked changes accepted as
follows.

Recommendations
The Faculty Council of Graduate Studies recommends THAT the 2017/18 Faculty of Graduate
Studies Academic Guide be approved by Senate.

Respectfully submitted,
Dr. Todd A. Mondor, Chair
Faculty Council of Graduate Studies

The Faculty of Graduate Studies Academic Guide contains all the rules and policies pertaining to the Faculty of
Graduate Studies. Adherence to these rules is of utmost importance for the effective functioning/operation of
programs and for guiding and monitoring the progress of students. The integrity of the process is at stake. The major
goal of this guide is to prevent potential problems that may affect the completion of a student’s program. It is the
responsibility of students and the unit offering a graduate program to read and follow the policies contained herein.
All regulations as laid out in the Faculty of Graduate Studies Academic Guide are subject to revision by the
appropriate bodies of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. This compendium is presented as the most recent set of
regulations as a guideline for students and staff. Individual departments may have additional regulations that
supplement these general regulations. All such supplementary procedures and regulations must be approved as
specified by the By-Laws of the Faculty of Graduate Studies, be published and available to students, and kept on file
in the Faculty of Graduate Studies Office.
For those programs that are administered through a Faculty (as opposed to a Department) the term “Department”
should be substituted by “Unit” within this document (i.e. Department Head becomes Unit Head.)

Note: In addition, foreign language students may be asked by the unit to complete the CanTEST prior to or
following registration in the Faculty of Graduate Studies and, if need be, the unit may recommend remedial
measures in language skills based on the results of the CanTEST. Some units may require a specific test or
test scores greater than those indicated above. Students should check departmental supplemental regulations
for details.

1.1.8 English Language Proficiency Test Exemption List
Applicants holding secondary school diplomas and/or recognized university degrees from countries on the Faculty
of Graduate Studies English Language exemption list are not required to submit an English Language Proficiency
score. For more information please see our website at
http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/admissions/english_exemption_list.htm
1.1.9 Letters of Recommendation
Letters of Recommendation are to be completed via UMGradConnect, the online application. Applicants are
required to add their ‘Recommendation Provider(s)’ contact information so that each recommender is sent an
automated email notification.
Generally, two Letters of Recommendation must be submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies. For the number
of recommendation letters necessary, applicants should review our ‘Additional Document Requirements’
webpage, http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/admissions/additional_requirements.html.

1.1.10 Admission Tests
Some units require admissions tests, such as the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or the Graduate
Management Aptitude Test (GMAT). These requirements are listed in the supplemental regulations of the
particular unit, and if required, the scores must be submitted at the time of application.
1.1.11 Entrance Requirements

219

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
The minimum standard for acceptance into any category in the Faculty of Graduate Studies is a 3.0 Grade Point
Average (GPA) or equivalent in the last two previous years of full time university study (60 credit hours).
Note: This is the minimum requirement of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and units may have higher standards
and additional criteria.

1.1.12 Eligibility of University of Manitoba Staff Members
A staff member at The University of Manitoba at the rank of Assistant Professor or above is not eligible to apply
for admission to a graduate program in the unit in which the appointment is held.

1.2 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES
1.2.1 Registration
Undergraduate students are not allowed to register in graduate courses. Pre-Master's students are not allowed to
register in 7000-level courses or above, with the exception of GRAD 7500.
All graduate students must initially register in the term specified in their letter of acceptance as specified
in the Academic Schedule of the Graduate Calendar. Any student not registering by the registration deadline
for
the term specified in their letter of offer will be required to re-apply for admission. In exceptional circumstances
and with prior approval from the unit, a student may defer registration for up to one term following acceptance
into
the Faculty of Graduate Studies. In the case of international students, admission may be deferred, with prior
approval from the unit, for up to one year following acceptance.
All programs must be approved by the Head of the major unit or designate. Approval to take courses from
units outside the major unit must be obtained from the outside unit.
The approval or denial of admission and registration to two programs rests with the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies in consultation with the unit concerned. The approval/denial must be submitted to the Faculty of
Graduate Studies prior to the student’s admission/registration on the “Concurrent Curriculum Permission” form
(http://intranet.umanitoba.ca/student/records/2323.html)
Where a student does register in two programs, it is important to note that dual registration may affect funding,
and that completing a graduate program as a part-time student will affect eligibility for The University of Manitoba
Graduate Fellowship (UMGF) and
may limit other funding possibilities.

1.2.2 Re-Registration
All students must re-register in all fall,
winter and summer terms of his/her program until a degree is obtained
(with the
exception of pre-Master’s students). Failure to re-register will result in the student being
discontinued from his/her graduate program. A student who has been discontinued and would like to be
considered for continuation in a program must apply for re-admission, which is not guaranteed. The re-registration
requirement does not apply to occasional students, visiting students, pre-Master’s students, or students on an
Exceptional or Parental Leave of Absence (please refer to “Leave of Absence”, Section 8 of this Guide).
The notation ‘Discontinued Graduate Program’ will be placed on the academic record of any graduate student
who has failed to maintain continuous registration.

1.2.3 Registration Revisions
For designated periods subsequent to registration, approved revisions may be made. It is required that students
adhere to dates and deadlines as published in the Academic Schedule of the Graduate Academic Calendar.
Note: Graduate students are not permitted to withdraw from courses without written permission from their unit
Head on recommendation from their advisor/co-advisor (and/or advisory committee). The notation “Required to
Withdraw” may be placed on the academic record of any graduate student who has withdrawn from courses
without such approval.

1.2.4 Advisor Student Guidelines
All students in thesis/practicum programs, in consultation with their advisor/co-advisor, are required to complete
the Advisor Student Guidelines as soon as possible after registration but no later than at the time of submission of
the first Progress Report. The Advisor Student Guidelines form is available through JUMP.

220

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
1.2.5 Western Deans’ Agreement
This agreement was established in 1974 as an expression of co-operation and mutual support among universities
offering graduate programs in western Canada. Its primary purpose is the reciprocal enrichment of graduate
programs throughout western Canada. This agreement is not intended to preclude other agreements between
participating institutions. A list of the participating Universities can be found at http://wcdgs.ca/
1.2.5.1 The Western Deans’ Agreement normally provides an automatic tuition fee waiver for visiting students.
Graduate students paying normal required tuition fees to their home institution will not pay tuition fees to
the host institution.
1.2.5.2 Only degree level courses from recognized post-secondary institutions will be considered; courses that
are part of certificate or diploma programs will not be approved.
1.2.5.3 Program fees are always to be paid to the home institution, regardless of coursework taken at another
institution. Students may be required to pay student, activity, application, or other ancillary fees to the
host institution, according to general policies in effect at the host institution. Wherever possible, these
fees will also be waived.
1.2.5.4 Students will qualify for the fee waiver if they:
a) present the “Authorization Form: Western Deans’ Agreement” signed by the Dean or designate and the unit
Head or advisor/co-advisor of a participating Western institution at least one (1) month prior to the start of
term, specifying the courses to be taken for credit toward a graduate degree program at their home institution;
b) are in good standing in a graduate program at the home institution;
c) do not owe tuition and/or fees at the home institution.
1.2.5.5 Students must meet all requirements as prescribed by the host university’s regulations, deadlines, class
capacities, and course prerequisites.
1.2.5.6 Registration is possible in courses at both the graduate and undergraduate levels, and in credit courses
offered through distance education or other means. To be eligible, courses must be an integral part of
the applicant’s graduate degree program. Fee waiver is not permitted for audit or non-credit courses.
1.2.5.7 Students must have the Authorization Form approved by the relevant unit Head and the Faculty of
Graduate Studies at the host institution at least one (1) month prior to the commencement of
the course(s) requested. The fee waiver is not available retroactively.
1.2.5.8 Students are subject to regulations of the home institution governing credit for the courses to be
undertaken. As a condition of registration at the host institution, students will arrange for official
transcripts from the host institution to be sent to the home institution confirming successful completion of
courses selected.
1.2.5.9 Students must send confirmation of registration and notice of any change to the Registrar's Office of the
home institution at the time of registration or course change is completed.
1.2.5.10 Students may not claim fee waivers under the terms of this Agreement for a period of more than 12
months in total.
1.2.5.11 Each institution has its own regulations regarding the maximum number of transfer credits permitted in a
given degree program. A list of the participating Universities can be found at http://wcdgs.ca/

1.3 COURSE CLASSIFICATIONS
1.3.1 General Classifications
Students who register through Aurora Student Information System (Aurora Student) must also have prior approval
of the unit Head or designate. Students registering through Aurora Student should add only those courses that are
a Major (Standard "S") course in their program. Courses with Auxiliary “X”, Audit “A”, or Occasional “O” status
(see below) must be added by the unit.

221

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18

“X” Auxiliary course: Course is not a major requirement of the program but is required by the student’s advisor/coadvisor.** Extra courses that are not part of the Master’s or Ph.D. program but which are specified and required
by the student’s advisor/co-advisor, may be classified as X (Auxiliary) and the grade will not be included in the
degree GPA which appears on the transcript. However, X course grades may be used in the calculation of the
GPA for continuation in the program and a minimum grade requirement may be required for X coursework by the
unit. (Please consult the individual unit’s supplemental regulations.) Additionally, X courses are used in the
calculation of the GPA for the purposes of Admission and Awards. (The University of Manitoba Graduate
Fellowship [UMGF] and International Graduate Student Scholarship [IGSS] use X courses in the calculation of
the GPA.) The student’s advisor/co-advisor and unit Head must determine if there is a valid need for the
registration in courses under the X classification. A maximum of 12 credit hours under the X course classification
is permitted while registered in a given program.
“A” Audit course: Course is not taken for credit. No grade is recorded. Additional fees will be assessed.
“O” Occasional course: Course is not a requirement of the program. Additional fees will be assessed.
** Note: Changes in course classifications are regarded as course/program changes and may not be made
without approval (refer to the “Registration Revision” section of this Guide) or after the deadline dates for course
changes as indicated in the Academic Schedule of the Calendar.

1.3.2 Continuing Courses (CO)
For those graduate level courses (6000, 7000, and 8000) which are being taken by students enrolled in the
Faculty of Graduate Studies and which continue beyond the normal academic term, the instructor shall
recommend that a mark classification of “CO” be used until such time as a final grade can be established. If the
course is not completed by August 31, the student must re-register for the course(s).
In the absence of an assigned mark of “CO”, the student may receive a mark of “F” in that term.
Note: A CO will normally not be permitted longer than twelve months. In exceptional circumstances, where a CO
grade is requested for a second twelve months, at the time the CO grade is submitted, the instructor and unit
Head must also submit the “Recommendation for Continuing Status of a Course” form stating the reason for the
CO and the deadline by which the course must be completed.
1.3.3 Incomplete Courses
Students who are unable to complete the term work prescribed in a course may apply to the instructor prior to the
end of term for consideration of a grade classification of “Incomplete”. It is understood that the student is to write
the final examination if one is scheduled for the course. Taking into account the results of the final examination,
the value of the term work completed, and the extent of the incomplete term work, the instructor shall calculate the
temporary grade using a zero value for incomplete work.
Normally, the following maximum extensions are allowed:
st
 August 1 for courses terminated in April
st
 December 1 for courses terminated in August
st
 April 1 for courses terminated in December
If a final grade is not reported within one month of the extension deadline, the Incomplete (I) classification will be
dropped and the grade will remain as awarded. The student will no longer have an opportunity to improve the
grade. In no case will the satisfaction of the incomplete requirements result in a lower grade being awarded.

1.4 STUDENT STATUS/CATEGORIES OF STUDENTS
1.4.1 Full-Time and Part-Time Students
Graduate students are initially admitted with full time status unless a “Part-Time Status Form”
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html) has been received.
Graduate
student status is not determined by the number of credit hours taken per term.
Therefore, students who
spend much of the time in a laboratory or library engaged in research or writing a
thesis/practicum, or who spend
part of the academic year engaged in research elsewhere, are regarded as fulltime students.
Student status should be determined by the student and advisor/co-advisor, and changes must be requested on
the “Part-Time Status Form”

222

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). The form must be approved by the unit Head
and submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Declaration of full/part time status must be made prior to the end of the registration revision period in the Fall
and/or Winter terms and within one month of the start of the Summer term.
For every full year (twelve months) a Master’s student is declared as part time they will receive an additional four
months in time to complete their program. For every two years (24 months) a Master’s student is declared as part
time they will receive an additional year (12 months) in time to complete their program. For every two years (24
months) a Ph.D. student is declared as part time they will receive an additional four months in time to complete
their program. Retroactive status changes will not be made.
1.4.2 Pre-Master’s Or Qualifying Students
In specific cases where the academic background of the student is judged to be insufficient for the given program
in a unit, the unit may recommend that the student be admitted to a pre-Master’s program of study. The preMaster’s program is intended to bring the student’s standing to approximately the level of an Honours graduate in
the major unit, and to provide any necessary prerequisites for courses.

1.4.3 Occasional Students
A student wishing to take graduate courses with no intention of applying them toward an advanced degree at The
University of Manitoba is classified as an occasional student. Occasional students must meet the same degree
and grade point average entrance requirements as regular graduate students and must write final examinations in
the courses taken (unless audited), but will not receive credit toward a degree. In special circumstances, an
occasional student may apply for permission to proceed to a degree program and also apply for transfer, for
credit, of courses previously taken in the occasional category.
Note:
1. Transfer of courses from the “occasional” category to a degree program is not automatic: request for
advance credit must be made within the first year of a degree program.
2. Fees paid by a student while registered as an occasional student are not transferable, at a later date, to a
degree program.
3. Registration in the occasional student category can be for no more than one academic year without
reapplication.
4. At least 60% of coursework per academic year must be taken at the graduate level while registered as an
occasional student.
1.4.4 Joint Masters (With the University of Winnipeg)
The University of Manitoba and the University of Winnipeg offer four joint Master’s programs: History, Religion,
Public Administration, and Peace and Conflict Studies. The University of Manitoba Faculty of Graduate Studies is
responsible for the administration of the joint programs, and students must complete the regular University of
Manitoba application and registration forms. Students taking pre-Master’s qualifying work for these programs
register at the university where the courses are being taken.
1.4.5 Visiting Students
Visiting students are students who are registered at another institution who are taking one or more courses at The
University of Manitoba on a Letter of Permission from their home university. Visiting students must submit an
online application, along with a $100.00 (CDN) application fee, in addition to copies of transcripts from all
institutions attended and a successfully completed English Language Proficiency Test from the approved list, if
applicable. Applications must be submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies a minimum of one (1) month prior
to the start of the intended term of study.
Note:
1. Fees paid by a student while registered as a visiting student are not transferable, at a later date, to a degree
program.
2. Registration in the visiting student category can be for no more than one academic year without
reapplication.

223

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18

3. At least 60% of coursework per academic year must be taken at the graduate level while registered as a
visiting student.

SECTION 2: Academic Performance – General
2.1 GENERAL NOTE
Students are responsible for ensuring that they meet all degree and program requirements. The advisor (and if
appropriate co-advisor), advisory committee, and unit must ensure that each student follows FGS and Unit
guidelines and meets all program requirements. The Faculty of Graduate Studies performs a final check of Faculty of
Graduate Studies minimum requirements for each student just prior to graduation. Students are cautioned, therefore,
to periodically check all regulations with respect to their degree requirements. Failure to meet all the requirements will
render a student ineligible to graduate.
Units may make recommendations with respect to the regulations concerning minimum academic performance;
however, enforcement of academic regulations rests with the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The following procedures
apply to recommendations made by units:
The unit is responsible for informing the Faculty of Graduate Studies when a student’s performance is unsatisfactory
in research or coursework and the unit must outline any recommended remedial action(s).
The unit must notify the student of the deficiency and of its recommendation.
If the student fails to satisfy any remedial action recommended, the student may be required to withdraw from the
Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Note: When a graduate student is required to withdraw from a program of study, the notation on the academic record
will be: “Required to withdraw”.
A student who has been required to withdraw from a graduate program may be permitted to apply for admission to
another graduate program only if the application for admission is approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies.
Voluntary withdrawal from a program is only permitted if the student is in good academic standing.
Recommendations of units will supersede student requests for voluntary withdrawal.

2.2 BONAFIDE ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS (BFAR)
The following Bona Fide Academic Requirements (BFAR) represent the core academic requirements a graduate
student must acquire in order to gain, and demonstrate acquisition of, essential knowledge and skills. Students must
also meet additional requirements that may be specified for their program.
Students must meet requirements as outlined in both BFARs and Supplementary Regulation documents as approved
by Senate.
Unless otherwise indicated, students may elect to complete any/all of the following requirements with or without
appropriate and authorized assistive technology/aids. Students must consult Student Accessibility Services (SAS)
regarding authorization for these procedures.

2.3 ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE
Student progress shall be reported at least annually, (but not to exceed once per term, to the Faculty of Graduate
Studies on the “Progress Report” form (http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html).
Students who fail to maintain satisfactory performance may be required to withdraw on the recommendation of the
Graduate Chair/unit Head to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the “Progress Report” form. Two
consecutive “in need of improvements” normally requires the student to withdraw.

2.4 PERFORMANCE IN COURSEWORK
A minimum degree grade point average (DGPA) of 3.0 with no grade below C+ must be maintained to continue in the
Faculty of Graduate Studies. Units may specify, in their supplementary regulations, standards that are higher than
those of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Students who fail to maintain the specified grades will be required to
withdraw unless a unit recommends remedial action. Any such action must be approved by the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies.
A student may be permitted to remove deficiencies in grades by repeating the course or replacing it with an
equivalent substitute course. Each failed course may be repeated or replaced only once, to a maximum of 6 credit
hours of coursework. If a course is repeated or replaced, the highest grade obtained will be used in the determination
of the degree grade point average. Students receiving a grade of C or less in more than 6 credit hours of coursework
are required to withdraw, unless otherwise stated in the unit’s supplemental regulations.
Note: In exceptional circumstances, the unit may appeal to the Faculty of Graduate Studies for approval of remedial
recommendation(s) falling outside those prescribed above.
Supplemental exams are not permitted to students in the Master’s or Ph.D. program, unless otherwise stated in the
unit’s supplemental regulations.
A summary of all actions taken administratively are to be reported to the Faculty of Graduate Studies Executive
Committee.

2.5 M ANDATORY ACADEMIC INTEGRITY COURSE
All students, including those in a pre-Master's program, are required to successfully complete GRAD 7500 Academic
Integrity Tutorial (0 credit hours) within their first term of initial registration.
Notes: Students who successfully complete GRAD 7500 Academic Integrity Tutorial at the Masters level are not
normally required to repeat the course at the Ph.D. level so long as continuous registration as a graduate student is
maintained.
Failure to complete this course will result in suspension of registration privileges and a grade of “F/NP” being
assigned to the course which may lead to being “Required to withdraw” from the graduate program.
Students on an exceptional/parental/regular leave of absence must register in GRAD 7500 upon return from leave if it
has not already been completed.

SECTION 3: General Regulations – Pre-Master’s
3.1 ADMISSION AND PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS
Graduates of bachelor degree programs with a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 in the last two full years of
university study will be considered for admission to a pre-Master’s program. These are the minimum requirements of
the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Units may specify higher or additional criteria. Admission to a pre-Master’s program
does not guarantee future admission to a Master’s program. As the pre-Master’s program of study is intended to bring
a student’s background up to the equivalent of the required 4-year degree, units should assign to students, as part of
their pre-Master’s program of study, an appropriate number of applicable upper level (3000 or 4000) undergraduate
courses. Graduate-level courses (7000 level or above)cannot be taken in a pre-Master’s program. Courses taken as
part of the pre-Master’s program may not be transferred to a Master’s program at a later date.

3.2 ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE
3.2.1. The unit Head is responsible for assigning the courses and monitoring the progress of each student.
3.2.2. A minimum degree grade point average of 3.0 with no grade below C+ must be maintained to continue in a
pre-Master’s program. Students who fail to maintain this standing will be required to withdraw unless remedial action
recommended by the unit (as described below) is approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
3.2.3. Students deficient in 6 hours of credit or less may be permitted to write a supplemental examination (when
offered in the unit’s supplemental regulations) in courses in which a grade of C or less was obtained.
3.2.4. Students deficient in 6 hours of credit or less with a grade of C, D, or F in a course or courses may be
permitted, if the overall average is C or better, to write one supplemental examination in each course (when permitted
by the unit’s supplemental regulations), to repeat the courses, or to take equivalent substitute courses.
Note: In exceptional circumstances, when a student is deficient in more than 6 credit hours, the student may be
permitted to repeat the pre-Master’s year, or to write supplemental examinations (when offered), or to substitute
equivalent coursework in order to make up the deficiencies.
A student may be permitted to repeat the pre-Master’s year only once, and to remove deficiencies in grades by
writing a supplemental examination or repeating courses only a maximum of once for each course to a maximum of 9
credit hours of coursework.
If a course is repeated or a supplemental examination is written, the most recent grade obtained in that course will be
used in the determination of the degree GPA.
The degree GPA is cumulative in a pre-Master’s program if more than one year is required to complete the course
requirements.
A summary of all action taken administratively is to be reported to the Faculty of Graduate Studies Executive
Committee.

 No more than half of the required coursework for the program can be given advance credit.
 A course may not be used for credit toward more than one degree, diploma, or certificate.
 The student must register at The University of Manitoba for at least two terms within a single academic year
and must also complete the thesis/practicum/project/comprehensive exam at The University of Manitoba.
Regardless of the extent of advanced credit granted, all students are required to pay applicable program fees.
4.4.6 Transfer Credit
Courses within a program of study may be taken elsewhere and transferred for credit at The University of Manitoba.
All such courses:
 must be approved for transfer to the program of study by the unit and the Faculty of Graduate Studies before
the student may register for them;
 are considered on an individual basis;
 cannot be used for credit towards another degree;
 may be taken at other universities while registered in a program at The University of Manitoba, provided that
the credit does not exceed 50% of the minimum credit hours of coursework required.
Permission is granted in the form of a Letter of Permission which may be obtained by making an application to the
Registrar’s Office; (http://umanitoba.ca/student/records/leave_return/710.html) an original transcript and course
equivalency must be provided.

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
4.5 Student’s Advisor/Co-Advisor
Each student should have an advisor upon entry into the program, and must have one assigned no later than one
term following registration. The advisor must:
 hold at least a Master’s degree or equivalent,
 be a member of the Faculty of Graduate Studies,
 have expertise in a discipline related to the student’s program, and
 hold an appointment in the student's unit.
It is the responsibility of the unit Head to determine whether faculty members meet these criteria, and also to report to
the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies on equivalency as necessary. Any exceptions or special circumstances
must be recommended by the unit Head and approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies who considers
each case on an individual basis.
In units where the choice of thesis/practicum topic and thesis/practicum advisor are postponed after a student’s entry
into the program, the unit Head, within one term, shall appoint a faculty member to advise the student in the interim
period before the regular advisor is assigned or chosen.
In special circumstances, an advisor and a maximum of one (1) co-advisor, upon approval of the unit Head, may
advise a student. The co-advisor must meet all of the same qualifications and expectations as the advisor. When an
advisor and co-advisor are assigned, together they shall fulfill the role of the advisor (that is, neither shall fulfill any
other advisory or examining committee membership requirements for that student). One advisor must be identified
as the primary advisor; however, both co-advisors’ signatures are required on all documents where the advisor’s
signature is required.
The advisor/co-advisor will advise the student on a program of study, direct research, and supervise the thesis or
practicum work.
A student who also holds an appointment at The University of Manitoba at the rank of Assistant Professor or above
cannot have an advisor or co-advisor with an appointment in the same unit.
The advisor, co-advisor (if applicable) and student must discuss, and complete, the Faculty of Graduate Studies
Advisor Student Guidelines (ASG) prior to the commencement of any research and no later than the submission of
the first Progress Report for the student. The advisor/co-advisor and the student are required to sign the agreement.
If the parties cannot agree on any component(s) of the ASG, the matter should be referred to the unit Graduate Chair,
Head of the unit, or the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Should, during the student’s program, the relationship between the student and advisor/co-advisor significantly
deteriorate, the matter should be referred to the unit Graduate Chair, the Head of the unit, or the Dean of the Faculty
of Graduate Studies.
All students should consult unit supplemental regulations for specific details regarding advisor/co-advisor
requirements.
4.6 Advisory Committee
4.6.1 Thesis/Practicum Route
Advisory committees are normally selected by the advisor/co-advisor in consultation with the student and should
consist of individuals whose expertise is consistent with that necessary to provide additional advice and guidance to
the student during his/her research program. The advisory committee must consist of a minimum of three members
(including the advisor/co-advisor), two of whom must be members of the Faculty of Graduate Studies
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/governance/academic_membership.html), one of whom must hold a
primary appointment from within the unit and one of whom must hold no appointment within the unit. It is expected,
under normal circumstances, that Advisory Committee members have a Master's degree or equivalent. Advisory
committees may include one non-voting guest member who has expertise in a related discipline but is not a member
of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. A student who also holds an appointment at The University of Manitoba at the
rank of Assistant Professor or above cannot have an advisor or co-advisor with an appointment in the same unit.
Graduate students may not serve on graduate student advisory committees.
The composition of, and any changes to, the advisory committee, including the advisor/co-advisor, must be approved
by the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The advisor/co-advisor is the Chair of the advisory committee.
Additional specifications, if any, regarding the advisory committee are found in the unit supplemental regulations and
students should consult these regulations for specific requirements.

231

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18

4.6.2 Course-based or Comprehensive Examination Route
Normally, advisory committees are not required in these routes, however any appropriate specifications regarding an
advisory committee can be found in the unit’s supplemental regulations and students should consult these regulations
for specific requirements.
4.6.3 Accredited professional programs
Normally, advisory committees are not required in these routes, however any appropriate specifications regarding an
advisory committee can be found in the unit’s supplemental regulations and students should consult these regulations
for specific requirements.
4.7 Courses and Performance
4.7.1 Course or Program Changes
Students are not permitted to change their program of study, including withdrawal from individual courses, without the
approval of their advisor/co-advisor (and/or advisory committee) and unit Head. Withdrawal from courses or changes
of course category without such approval may result in the student being required to withdraw from the Faculty of
Graduate Studies.
4.7.2 Lapse of Credit of Courses
Courses completed more than seven years prior to the date of awarding of a degree may not normally be used for
credit toward that degree.
4.7.3 Academic Performance
Student progress shall be reported at least annually (but no more than once per term) to the Faculty of Graduate
Studies on the “Progress Report” form (http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). Students
who fail to maintain satisfactory performance may be required to withdraw on the recommendation of the Graduate
Chair/unit Head to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the “Progress Report” form. Two consecutive “in
need of improvement” ratings will normally result in withdrawal of the student from the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
4.7.4 Performance in Coursework
A minimum degree grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 with no grade below C+ must be maintained to continue in the
Faculty of Graduate Studies. Units may specify, in their supplementary regulations, standards that are higher than
those of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Students who fail to maintain the specified grades will be required to
withdraw unless a unit recommends remedial action. Any such action must be approved by the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies.
4.7.5 Performance not related to Coursework
In some units, students are required to demonstrate satisfactory academic performance in areas not related to
performance in courses, such as attendance at or participation in course lectures, seminars and in laboratories and
progress in research, thesis or practicum. The specific nature of satisfactory academic performance is outlined in
individual unit supplemental regulations and students should consult these supplemental regulations for specific
requirements. Unacceptable performance must be reported to the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the “Progress
Report” form (http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). Students who fail to maintain
satisfactory performance may be required to withdraw on the recommendation of the unit Head to the Dean of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies.
4.8 Requirements for Graduation
All students must:
 maintain a minimum degree grade point average of 3.0 with no grade below C+,
 meet the minimum and not exceed the maximum course requirements, and
 meet the minimum and not exceed the maximum time requirements.
Individual units may have additional specific requirements for graduation and students should consult unit
supplemental regulations for these specific requirements.
4.8.1 Thesis/Practicum Route
4.8.1.1 Thesis vs. Practicum
Students must demonstrate their mastery of the field and that they are fully conversant with the relevant literature
through their thesis/practicum.

232

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
A practicum differs from the thesis in its emphasis on the application of theory, it is however similar in scope, span,
and rigour. The practicum takes the form of an exercise in the practical application of knowledge and skill. It usually
involves the careful definition of a problem, the application of appropriate knowledge and skills to the problem, and a
report of the results in a manner suitable for evaluation by an examining committee. Individual units have specific
requirements for graduation and students should consult unit supplemental regulations for specific requirements.
The thesis is developed under the mentorship of the advisor/co-advisor. Individual units may have specific guidelines
regarding the thesis proposal and its acceptance by the student’s advisory committee/unit Head; students should
consult unit supplemental regulations for specific requirements. Research must be approved by the appropriate
Human Research Ethics Board or Animal Care Committee, if applicable, before the work has begun on the thesis
research.
4.8.1.2 Examining Committee
The advisor/co-advisor will recommend an examining committee to the unit Head for approval, which shall then be
reported to the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the “Master’s Thesis/Practicum Title and Appointment of Examiners”
form (http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). This form must be approved by the Dean of
the Faculty of Graduate Studies at least two weeks prior to the distribution of the thesis.
Under normal circumstances, the examining committee will be the same as the advisory committee unless otherwise
stipulated in the unit’s supplemental regulations. The examining committee must consist of a minimum of three
members (including the advisor/co-advisor), two of whom must be members of the Faculty of Graduate Studies, one
of whom must hold an appointment from within the unit, and one of whom must hold no appointment within the unit.
All examiners must be deemed qualified by the unit Head and be willing to serve. It is expected that, under normal
circumstances, Examination Committee members will have a Master's degree or equivalent. The composition of, and
any changes to, the examining committee, including the advisor/co-advisor, must be approved by the Faculty of
Graduate Studies. Individual units establish specific requirements for examination and students should consult unit
supplemental regulations for specific requirements.
The Head of the unit arranges for the distribution of the thesis/practicum to the examiners. It is the duty of all
examiners to read the thesis/practicum and report on its merits according to the following categories:
 Acceptable, without modification or with minor revision(s); or
 Acceptable, subject to modification and/or revision(s); or
 Not acceptable.
If two or more examiners do not approve the thesis, then the student is deemed to have failed the distribution.
4.8.1.3 Oral Examination
For units requiring students to pass an oral examination on the subject of the thesis/practicum and matters relating
thereto, the format of the oral examination is described in the supplementary regulations of the unit. Students should
consult these supplemental regulations for specific requirements. A student has the right to an examination of the
thesis/practicum if he/she believes it is ready for examination. It is the unit’s responsibility to advise the student of any
risk involved should he/she decide to proceed against the unit’s recommendation.
All members of the examining committee should be present at the examination. If an examining committee member
cannot attend the defence, prior approval must be obtained from the Faculty of Graduate studies for the defence to
proceed. Under no circumstances can the student participate by video conferencing. No recording devices will be
permitted.
The oral examination shall be open to all members of The University of Manitoba community except in exceptional
cases. The oral examination may be closed, for example, when the results of the thesis/practicum research must be
kept confidential for a period of time. In such cases, the examining committee and unit Head shall recommend such
action to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies who shall then decide whether to grant that the final
examination be closed to all but the examining committee and the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Following completion of the examination of the thesis/practicum, examiners will consider the oral examination and the
written thesis/practicum.
The examiners will also determine the nature of and procedures for approval of any revisions that will be required
prior to submission of the thesis/practicum to the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The advisor/co-advisor is normally
responsible for ensuring that revisions are completed according to the instructions from the examining committee.
The judgement of the examiners shall be reported to the Faculty of Graduate Studies in the qualitative terms
“approved” or “not approved” on the “Thesis/practicum final report” form
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). Each examiner must indicate his/her opinion by

233

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
his/her signature. If two or more examiners do not approve the thesis, then the student is deemed to have failed the
defence.
The examining committee may recommend to the Faculty of Graduate Studies that the thesis is of sufficient merit to
receive an award.
4.8.1.4 Failure
In the case of a failure of the thesis/practicum at the Master’s level, a detailed written report will be prepared by the
Chair of the examination committee and submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies, who will make the report
available to the student and advisor/co-advisor.
A student will be required to withdraw when the thesis/practicum has been rejected twice at the stage where:
 The examining committee reports on the merits of the written thesis;
 The defence; or
 A combination of both stages.



The examining process should be completed within one month of distribution of the thesis/practicum.
4.8.2 Course-based or Comprehensive Examination Route
Students must demonstrate his/her mastery of their field. The specific procedures for evaluation of this mastery are
stated in individual units’ supplemental regulations. Students should consult the unit’s supplemental regulations for
specific requirements.
In those units where comprehensive examinations are required, students should consult the unit’s supplemental
regulations for specific requirements. The results of the comprehensive examinations shall be submitted to the
Faculty of Graduate Studies on the “Report on comprehensive examination” form
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html) in the terms "pass" or "fail." No student may sit
comprehensive examinations more than twice. Any student who receives a "fail" on the comprehensive examination
twice will be required to withdraw from the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
4.9 Style and Format
The thesis/practicum must be written according to a standard style acknowledged by a particular field of study (see
Appendix 1).
4.10 Deadlines for Graduation
The final requirements of the degree, in the form of the final report on the thesis/practicum (and the corrected copy of
the thesis/practicum); comprehensive examination; M.Eng. project; or Design thesis, must be submitted to the Faculty
of Graduate Studies by the appropriate deadline. For those programs that do not have a culminating exercise
(thesis/practicum/comprehensive examination/M.Eng. project/Design thesis) the unit must forward potential graduate
names to the Faculty of Graduate Studies by the deadline. The deadline for each of the graduation dates is published
on the Faculty of Graduate Studies website at umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/deadlines/index.html.
4.11 Details for Submission of the Final Copy
Following the approval of the thesis/practicum by the examining committee and the completion of any revisions
required by that committee, the thesis/practicum, must be submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies as follows:
 One digital version submitted as an e-thesis/practicum at the MSpace website
(http://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/xmlui/login)
 Final approval
 Copyright License Declaration form.
4.12 Publication and Circulation of Thesis/Practicum
Every graduate student registering in a thesis/practicum Master’s program at The University of Manitoba shall be
advised that, as a condition of being awarded the degree, he/she will be required to grant a license of partial
copyright to the University and to the Library and Archives Canada for any thesis or practicum submitted as part of
their degree program.
Note: This license makes the thesis/practicum available for further research only. Publication for commercial
purposes remains the sole right of the author.
The thesis release form, including the copyright declaration/infringement form, must be completed on MSpace. This
and other related regulations may give rise to important questions of law, and students may need additional legal
advice on the copyright laws of Canada and/or other countries. Students who wish to obtain legal advice concerning

234

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18

SECTION 5: Doctor of Philosophy General Regulations
SECTION 5: Doctor of Philosophy General Regulations
The degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) is granted only upon evidence of general proficiency and of distinctive
attainment in a special field. In particular, the candidate must demonstrate an ability for independent investigation,
original research or creative scholarship. This is expected to be presented in a thesis with a degree of literary skill
and by an oral examination wherein the candidate exhibits mastery of their field. The Ph.D. is a research degree and
is not conferred by The University of Manitoba solely as a result of coursework study.
Although general regulations apply to all students, individual units may have additional regulations that supplement
these general regulations. All such supplemental regulations must be approved (as specified by the By-Laws of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies), be published and available to students
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/admin/supplemental_regulations.html), and be kept on record in the
Faculty of Graduate Studies. All students should consult unit supplemental regulations for specific details regarding
admission, program requirements, progression, and completion.
5.1 Admission
5.1.1 General criteria
Normally, the completion of a Master’s degree or equivalent from a recognized university and a cumulative GPA of
3.0 or equivalent in the last two previous years of full time university study (60 credit hours) is the minimum
requirement for admission to the Ph.D. program. Note: This is the minimum requirement of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies and units may have higher standards and additional criteria. However, the criteria for admissions into the
Ph.D. program are more stringent than for Masters’ programs; therefore, the completion of a Master’s program does
not guarantee admission into the Ph.D. program. Some units require completion of a thesis-based Master’s program
prior to admission to a Ph.D. program.
5.1.2 Direct Admission from the Bachelor’s Honours or equivalent
With special recommendation of the unit concerned, applicants with an honours Bachelor’s degree or equivalent may
be considered for entry to Ph.D. study. These students must be outstanding in their academic background (GPA well
above 3.0 in the last two full years of undergraduate study). Note: This is the minimum requirement of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies and units may have higher standards and additional criteria. Once admitted, these students must
complete at least 24 credit hours of coursework, unless the individual unit’s approved supplemental regulations
specify otherwise, and will be assessed Ph.D. fees for 3 years.
5.1.3 Transfer from the Master’s to the Ph.D. program
Students who have not completed a Master’s program may transfer to the Ph.D. program within the same unit upon
the recommendation by the Head of the unit to the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The recommendation should be
made within 4 terms (including summer term) from the start of the Master’s program. The coursework completed and
time spent in the Master’s program will normally be credited towards the Ph.D. program. Students must complete at
least 24 credit hours of coursework, unless the individual unit’s approved supplemental regulations specify otherwise.
The request to transfer from a Master’s to the Ph.D. program must be submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies at
least one month prior to the term for which the student intends to commence the Ph.D. program. The following are
required when making the request: The online Application for Admission indicating a request for transfer. If the
transfer is made within one year, no additional application fee must be paid. In the case where the student does not
hold a Master’s degree, a letter of recommendation from the Head of the unit is also required.
If the transfer occurs within 12 months of the initial registration in the Master’s program, the student will be assessed
Ph.D. fees for 3 years. If the transfer occurs after 12 months, the student will be assessed Ph.D. program fees for 2
years (as they will have already paid fees for the Master’s program). Students are cautioned that such transfers may
impact on The University of Manitoba Graduate Fellowship duration.
Where a student with a Master’s degree or equivalent is initially admitted and registered in a Master’s program, that
student may be transferred to the Ph.D. program within the same unit on the recommendation of the student’s
advisor/co-advisor and Head of the unit, provided that follow up transfer recommendation occurs within 12 months of
the initial registration in the Master’s program. In such a case, the application fee is waived and fees assessed
towards the Master’s program will be deducted from the full 2 years of Ph.D. program fees. Transfers later than 12
months must pay an application fee and their fees will be assessed as a 3 year Ph.D.
5.1.4 Provisional Admission to the Ph.D.

236

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
Students nearing the completion of the Master’s degree may be accepted provisionally to the Ph.D. program for a 12
month period (commencing with the first registration in the Ph.D. program). Further registration in the Ph.D. program
is contingent upon completion of all requirements of the Master’s degree within the 12 months. Students must
maintain continuous registration in their Master’s program until its completion. Students will require assistance from
the unit and the Faculty of Graduate Studies to complete dual registration on the “Concurrent Curriculum Permission”
form (http://intranet.umanitoba.ca/student/records/2323.html)
in the Master’s and Ph.D. program simultaneously.
5.1.5 English Language Proficiency
See section 1.1.7. Some units specify an additional language requirement for the Ph.D. degree. Students should
check unit supplemental regulations regarding this requirement.
5.1.6 Students with Disabilities
See Accommodation Policy for Students with Disabilities:
http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/students/281.html
5.2 Student Advisor, Co-advisor and Advisory Committee
5.2.1 Student Advisor
Every Ph.D. student must have an advisor, appointed by the Head of the unit. The advisor is responsible for
supervising the student’s graduate program. The advisor is the student’s first point of contact at The University of
Manitoba, and therefore should be familiar with the general policies and regulations of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies as well as the specific supplementary regulations of their academic unit. The advisor is directly responsible
for the supervision of the student's graduate program. In this capacity, the advisor assists the student in planning the
graduate program, and ensures that the student is aware of all graduate program requirements, degree regulations,
and general regulations of the academic unit, the Faculty of Graduate Studies, the university, and external funding
agencies. The advisor provides counsel for all aspects of the graduate program, and stays informed of the student's
scholarly activities and progress. The student’s advisor also acts as a channel of communication to the student’s
advisory committee, the unit, and the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
The advisor must:
 be a member of the Faculty of Graduate Studies;
 hold a Ph.D. or equivalent*;
 be active in research;
 have expertise in a discipline related to the student’s program;
 hold an appointment in the student's unit.
*Equivalency will be approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and determined on a case by case
basis and assessed by the potential advisor’s demonstrated research record and current research activities. Note that
M.D., D.M.D. and J.D. are undergraduate degrees and are not equivalent to a Ph.D.
Usually the student and the advisor choose to work together by mutual agreement. In units where the choice of thesis
topic advisor is postponed for some time after entry into the program, the Head of the unit or the selection committee
shall appoint a faculty member to advise the student as to the rules and regulations and on a program and course
requirements. This interim period must not exceed eighteen months after entry in to the program before a permanent
advisor is chosen.
A staff member at the University of Manitoba at the rank of Assistant Professor or above cannot have an advisor/coadvisor with an appointment in the same unit.
The advisor, co-advisor (if applicable) and student must discuss, and complete, the Faculty of Graduate Studies
Advisor Student Guidelines (ASG) prior to the commencement of any research and no later than the submission of
the first Progress Report for the student. If the parties cannot agree on any component(s) of the ASG, the matter
should be referred to the unit Graduate Chair, the Head of the unit, or the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Should, during the student’s program, the relationship between the student and advisor significantly deteriorate, the
matter should be referred sequentially to the unit Graduate Chair, the Head of the unit, then to the Dean of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.2.2 Co-advisor
In special circumstances, upon approval of the Head of the unit, an advisor and a maximum of one (1) co-advisor
may advise a student. The co-advisor must meet all of the same qualifications and expectations as the advisor.

237

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
The co-advisor will usually be identified either:
A) at the beginning of a student’s program in situations where:
1. the student desires to draw equally upon the expertise of two individuals, or
2. the project is interdisciplinary in nature and requires the expertise of two advisors from their respective disciplines
or
B) mid-way through a student’s program due to:
1. the student's project developing in such a way as he/she requiring an additional advisor from a different
discipline; or
2. the unit introducing a new Faculty member, to the standards of the unit, whose expertise facilitates the
student's project.
When an advisor and co-advisor are assigned, together they shall fulfill the role of the advisor (that is, neither shall
fulfill any other advisory or examining committee membership requirements for that student). One advisor must be
identified as the primary advisor; however, both the advisor and co-advisor’s signatures are required on all
documents where the advisor’s signature is required.
A student who also holds an appointment at The University of Manitoba at the rank of Assistant Professor or above
cannot have an advisor or co-advisor with an appointment in the same unit.
In all instances the Faculty of Graduate Studies must be informed of, and approve, the co-assignment.
5.2.3 Advisory Committee
The Head of the unit is responsible for the establishment of an advisory committee for each Ph.D. student. Advisory
committees are normally selected by the advisor/co-advisor in consultation with the student and should consist of
individuals whose expertise is consistent with that necessary to provide additional advice and guidance to the student
during his/her program. The advisory committee must consist of a minimum of three members of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies, one of whom must hold a primary appointment from within the unit and one of whom must hold no
appointment within the unit. Advisory committees may, in addition, include one non-voting guest member who has
expertise in a related discipline but is not a member of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
It is expected that Advisory Committee members will have a Ph.D. degree or equivalent. Equivalency will be
determined by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Graduate students may not serve on graduate student
advisory committees. A student who also holds an appointment at The University of Manitoba at the rank of Assistant
Professor or above cannot have an advisor or co-advisor with an appointment in the same unit. The composition of,
and any changes to, the advisory committee, including the advisor/co-advisor, must be approved by the Faculty of
Graduate Studies on the “Program of study & appointment of advisory committee” form
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). The advisor/co-advisor is the Chair of the advisory
committee. Advisory committee meetings must be held at least annually, and are not intended to take the place of
meetings between the student and advisor/co-advisor which should occur with much greater frequency than the
advisory committee meetings.
5.3 Program of Study
As soon as possible, but no later than 24 months after a student has commenced their program, the student’s
program of study should be registered with the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the “Program of study & appointment
of advisory committee” form (http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html) and should include:
 information about the minimum or expected time for completion of the degree;
 coursework to be taken;
 any foreign language requirement;
 the research area in which the thesis will be written.
The approval of the student’s advisor/co-advisor and the Head of the unit are sufficient for registration. The program
of study, including withdrawal from individual courses and any subsequent changes, must be approved by the
student’s advisor/co-advisor, the advisory committee, and the Head of the unit. Withdrawal from courses or changes
of course category without such approval may result in the student being required to withdraw from the Faculty of
Graduate Studies.
5.4 Program Requirements

238

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
All students must complete one of the following programs of study for the Ph.D. degree, unless otherwise specified in
the approved unit supplemental regulations:
 Where admission to the Ph.D. is directly from a Master’s degree, a minimum of 12 credit hours at the 7000
level or higher plus a thesis is required. Any further coursework beyond the minimum 12 credit hours at the
7000 level must be at the 3000 level or above. For those students who hold a Master’s degree, a maximum
of 24 credit hours of coursework is allowed toward the Ph.D. program.
 Where admission to the Ph.D. is directly from an Honours Bachelor degree or equivalent, a minimum of 24
credit hours plus a thesis is required. The coursework must include a minimum of 18 credit hours at the
7000 level or higher with the balance of the coursework at the 3000 level or higher. For those students who
do not hold a Master’s degree, a maximum of 48 credit hours of coursework is allowed toward the Ph.D.
program.

5.4.1 Language Reading Requirements
Some units specify a language requirement for the Ph.D. degree. Students are advised to check unit supplemental
regulations regarding this requirement.
5.4.2 Advance Credit
Advance credit for courses completed prior to admission to a Ph.D. program will be considered on an individual basis.
The student’s unit makes the request to the Faculty of Graduate Studies by completing the “ Advance Credit Transfer of Courses” form (http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html).
 Application for advance credit must be made within the first year of the program (see Lapse of Credit of
Courses in this section for course currency).
 No more than half of the required coursework for the program can be given advance credit.
 A course may not be used for credit toward more than one degree, diploma or certificate.
 The student must register at The University of Manitoba for at least two consecutive terms and must also
complete the thesis and candidacy examination at The University of Manitoba.
Regardless of the extent of advanced credit received, all students are required to pay applicable program fees.
5.4.3 Transfer Credit
Courses within a program of study may be taken elsewhere and transferred for credit at The University of Manitoba.
All such courses:
 must be approved for transfer to the program of study by the unit and the Faculty of Graduate Studies before
the student may register for them;
 are considered on an individual basis;
 cannot be used for credit towards another degree;
 may be taken at other universities while registered in a program at The University of Manitoba, provided that
the credit does not exceed 50% of the minimum credit hours of coursework required.
Permission is granted in the form of a Letter of Permission which may be obtained by making an application to the
Registrar’s Office; (http://umanitoba.ca/student/records/leave_return/710.html) an original transcript, and course
equivalency must be provided.
5.4.4 Lapse of Credit of Courses
Courses completed more than seven years prior to the date of awarding of a degree may not normally be used for
credit toward that degree.
5.5 Time Limits
5.5.1 Minimum Time Limit
The minimum time requirement for the program of study for a Ph.D. degree will normally be two years of study
beyond the level of the Master’s degree, or three years beyond the level of a Bachelor’s degree. The student may be
permitted to spend one of these years in an approved program of research or study elsewhere. Such permission
must be approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the recommendation of the student’s advisory
committee.
5.5.2 Maximum Time Limit
A student’s candidature shall lapse if he/she fails to complete the degree within six years following initial registration
in the Ph.D. program. For those students who transfer from the Master’s to the Ph.D., years spent in the Master’s
program are counted as years in the Ph.D. program.

239

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
Ph.D. students who are declared as part-time will receive an additional four months in time to complete their program
for every two years (24 months) they are declared as part time (see section 1.4.1) to a maximum of seven years.
Requests for extensions of time to complete the degree will be considered on an individual basis and must be
submitted to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies “Time Extension Request Form”
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html) at least three, but no more than four, months
prior to expiration of the respective maximum time limit.
A student who has not completed the degree requirements within the time limit or within the time limit of any
extension that has been granted (see also sections “Extension of Time to Complete Program of Study” and “Leave of
Absence”) will be required to withdraw from the Faculty of Graduate Studies and the notation on the student record
will be “Required to withdraw”.
5.6 Academic Performance
Student progress shall be reported at least annually (but no more than once per term) to the Faculty of Graduate
Studies on the “Progress Report” form (http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). Students
who fail to maintain satisfactory performance may be required to withdraw on the recommendation of the Graduate
Chair/unit Head to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the “Progress Report” form. Two consecutive “in
need of improvement” ratings normally result in withdrawal of the student from the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.6.1 Performance in Coursework
A minimum degree grade point average (DGPA) of 3.0 with no grade below C+ must be maintained to continue in the
Faculty of Graduate Studies. Units may specify, in their supplementary regulations, standards that are higher than
those of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Students who fail to maintain the specified grades will be required to
withdraw unless a unit recommends remedial action. Any such action must be approved by the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies.
5.6.2 Performance Not Related to Coursework
Students may be required to withdraw from their Ph.D. program for reasons of unsatisfactory performance other than
those related to failing grades. These include, but are not restricted to, unsatisfactory attendance and lack of progress
in research and/or thesis preparation. Unacceptable performance must be reported to the Faculty of Graduate
Studies on the “Progress Report” form (http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). Students
who fail to maintain satisfactory performance may be required to withdraw on the recommendation of the unit Head to
the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.7 Academic Requirement for Graduation
A cumulative degree grade point average of 3.0 or greater is required in those courses that constitute the program of
study for graduation in the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.8 Candidacy Examination
The candidacy examination is an absolute requirement of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and, as such, cannot be
waived under any circumstances. However, the format and content of the candidacy exam varies from unit to unit.
The purposes of the candidacy exam in doctoral programs is to determine the student's competence in the discipline
with respect to understanding and absorbing a broad spectrum of material, and then researching, identifying,
analysing, synthesizing, and communicating ideas about that material in depth.
At the time specified by the advisory committee - normally within the first year after the completion of the Ph.D.
program coursework but in no case later than one year prior to expected graduation - the student must successfully
complete the formal candidacy examination.
The examination is conducted according to a procedure established by the unit and approved by the Academic Guide
Committee of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Please see the unit supplemental regulations for the format and
composition of the examination committee for the candidacy examination. The candidacy examination must be held
at The University of Manitoba.
This examination, which must be independent from the thesis proposal, may be oral, written, or both and may cover
subjects relevant to the general area of the candidate's research. The structure of the exam must be made known to
students well in advance of the exam.
A pass decision of the examiners must be unanimous. Students must be provided with feedback on their
performance and access to the reasons for the pass/fail.

240

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies must be informed whether the candidate has passed or failed the
candidacy examination on the “Report on Ph.D. Candidacy Examination” form
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html).
Any student who fails the candidacy examination twice will be required to withdraw from the Faculty of Graduate
Studies.
On successful completion of this examination, the student will be considered a candidate for the Ph.D. degree.
5.9 Thesis Proposal
Some units have specific procedures in place for approval of thesis proposals and students are advised to refer to the
specific unit supplemental regulations. If units require thesis proposal approval, this exercise must be independent
from the candidacy examination. Regardless, the proposed thesis research must be approved by the advisory
committee and, if necessary, by the Human Research Ethics Board or Animal Care Committee before the work has
begun on the thesis research or project.
5.10 Thesis
An essential feature of Ph.D. study is the candidate’s demonstration of competence to complete a research project
and present the findings. The thesis must constitute a distinct contribution to knowledge in the major field of study,
and the research must be of sufficient merit to be, in the judgement of the examiners, acceptable for publication.
The thesis must be written according to a standard style acknowledged within the candidate’s particular field of study
and recommended by the unit, be lucid and well-written, and be reasonably free from errors of style and grammar
(including typographical errors).
The final version of the thesis must be submitted by the candidate to the Faculty of Graduate Studies following the
guidelines found at: http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/thesis/guidelines.html
5.11 Thesis Examination Procedures
The final examination for the Ph.D. degree proceeds in three stages (see Figure 5-1):
1. Examination of the candidate’s thesis by an internal examining committee.
2. Examination of the candidate’s thesis by an external examiner.
3. Oral examination of the candidate by all examiners on the subject of the thesis and any matters relating
thereto.
5.11.1 Formation of the Examining Committee I - University of Manitoba (Internal) Examiners
The candidate’s advisor (and, if appropriate, co-advisor) is considered to be a voting member of the examining
committee. The candidate’s advisor/co-advisor, in consultation with the Head of the unit, will recommend at least
three internal thesis examiners, including the advisor/co-advisor, to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies for
approval via the Thesis Submission Portal on JUMP. All voting members of the advisory committee are expected to
serve on the examining committee; any exceptions must be approved in advance by the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies. One member must hold an appointment within the unit and one member must hold no
appointment within the unit. All internal examiners must be members of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. It is
expected that Examining Committee members will have a Ph.D. degree or equivalent. Equivalency will be determined
by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Under normal circumstances these will be members of the
candidate’s advisory committee, if not, approval must be obtained from the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Note that in the case of an advisor and co-advisor, both together have a single vote on the examining committee.
5.11.2 Formation of the Examining Committee II - External Examiner
The candidate’s advisor/co-advisor, in consultation with the advisory committee, will recommend the names of three
distinguished scholars from outside The University of Manitoba with particular experience in the field of the thesis
research and Ph.D. student advisory/examination experience to serve as the external examiner to the Dean of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies for approval via the Thesis Submission Portal on JUMP. The recommendations should,
if possible, include a brief CV of each of the prospective external examiners and a short statement detailing the
rationale behind the recommendations, the prospective external examiners’ qualifications, including a current list of
his/her scholarly publications and research activities and, importantly, their experience with graduate student
education. No contact should be made with any of the prospective external examiners. If any of the recommended
examiners does not meet the following criteria, specified below, a detailed explanation should be included with the
rationale for the recommendation.
The external examiner must:
 hold a Ph.D. or equivalent;

241

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18




hold the rank of Associate Professor, Full Professor, Senior Scholar or Emeritus Professor (or the equivalent
if outside North America) at a university, or have comparable expertise and standing if not a faculty member
at a university;
have an established reputation in the area of the thesis research and be able to judge whether the thesis
would be acceptable at an institution comparable to The University of Manitoba; and
have a demonstrated record of supervising Ph.D. students to completion, and significant recent experience
with the supervision and/or examination of Ph.D. students.

The external examiner must not:
 have acted as an external examiner for a student of the same Ph.D. advisor within the previous two years;
 have been associated with the candidate at any time or in any significant way in the past five years, present
or reasonably foreseeable future (advisor/co-advisor, colleague, teacher, co-author of published material,
family member etc.); or
 be associated with the candidate’s advisor/co-advisor in any of the following ways:
o former student;
o research advisor/co-advisor;
o research collaborator within the last five years;
o co-author of published material within the last five years.
o have had a significant academic disagreement with the candidate, the advisor/co-advisor or any
member of the advisory committee.
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will choose the external examiner from the list provided by the
candidate’s advisor/co-advisor and will make the formal invitation to the external examiner. The Dean of the Faculty
of Graduate Studies shall ensure the anonymity of the external examiner until their report has been submitted .
5.11.3 Changes in the Examining Committee
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies must approve changes in the membership of the examining committee.
No changes shall be made in the examining committee after the thesis is submitted to the Faculty of Graduate
Studies. Should the thesis not be submitted for examination within 12 months after the appointment of the examining
committee, the committee appointment will lapse and the process shall revert to 5.11.1 above.
5.11.4 Distribution of the Thesis for Examination
Ph.D. candidates must submit their thesis for distribution electronically through JUMP. Consult this link for pertinent
instructions: http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/media/Thesis_Distribution_Portal.pdf. It is the
responsibility of the Faculty of Graduate Studies to distribute the electronic version of the thesis to all examiners. The
Faculty of Graduate Studies shall attempt to ensure that the thesis is distributed to examiners as soon as possible
after the submission of all required documentation. The Faculty of Graduate Studies website
(umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/deadlines/index.html) should be consulted regarding dates by which theses
must be submitted.
Once the thesis has been submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies, neither the candidate nor the advisor/coadvisor shall have any communication with the examining committee regarding the thesis. However, should the need
arise, the external examiner may contact the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies to discuss any issues related to
the thesis.
5.11.5 Responsibilities of the Examiners
In general, the examiners are responsible for:
 ensuring that the thesis and the candidate meet recognized scholarly standards for a Ph.D.;
 appraising the underlying assumptions, methodology, findings, and scholarly significance of the findings of
the thesis;
 ensuring that the thesis is organized, presents data and uses accepted conventions for addressing the
scholarly literature in an acceptable manner;
 evaluating that the candidate has the ability to present their findings orally and demonstrate their scholarship
by responding to questions and defending the thesis.
Notes:
1.
2.

Any potential breach of academic integrity should be reported to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies for investigation by the Vice President (Research and International).
Submission of previously published, peer-reviewed material in the thesis does not preclude its critical
examination, either as a written document being reviewed by examiners or at the thesis defence.

242

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
5.11.6 Process
Internal Examiners
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will request the internal examiners to give, within three (3) weeks of the
distribution of the thesis, a detailed written report of the thesis and place it into one of the following categories:
1. The thesis represents a distinct contribution to the candidate’s field of research and is acceptable as it
stands. Minor revisions to content, structure, or writing style may be required. The thesis may proceed to
external distribution.
2. The thesis has merit and makes a contribution to the candidate’s field; however, there are research-related
concerns that have the potential to be addressed in the oral defence. The structure and writing style are
acceptable or require some revision. The thesis may proceed to external distribution.
3. The thesis has some merit, but is not acceptable in its current state and requires revisions to one or more of
its core components, such as research content, structure or writing style. The thesis should not proceed to
external distribution.
4. The thesis is unacceptable with respect to its core components, such as research content, structure, and
writing style. The thesis should not proceed to external distribution.
If none or one (the dissenting voice) of the internal examiners fails the thesis (i.e. places it in categories 3 or 4
above), the thesis receives an internal pass and shall proceed to external distribution. The candidate’s advisor (and, if
appropriate, co-advisor) may also wish to submit a report. Prior to external distribution, the candidate shall have the
opportunity to incorporate changes suggested by the examining committee but not necessarily those of the dissenting
voice. It is the joint responsibility of the advisor/co-advisor and student to provide all internal committee members with
a copy of the revised thesis along with a written and detailed summary of all significant revisions made well in
advance of the oral defence.
If two or more members of the internal examining committee fail the thesis (i.e. places the thesis in categories 3 or 4
above) then the thesis fails.
If the thesis fails, the unit Head shall convene a meeting of the internal examining committee and the candidate’s
advisor/co-advisor to decide how to bring the thesis to an acceptable scholarly standard for a second submission to
the internal examining committee. In normal circumstances, this will involve additional scholarly work which the unit
Head will describe, in writing, to the advisor/co-advisor, the candidate, and the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies.
If two or more members of the internal examining committee fail the resubmitted thesis, this constitutes a second
failure. In the case of a second failure, the candidate cannot proceed to external distribution, and the candidate is
required to withdraw from the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
The awarding of a passing grade by an individual internal examiner does not preclude them from awarding a failing
grade at a subsequent stage in the examination process. The performance of a student at the oral examination may
reveal problems of comprehension or explanation, and the examining committee may require revisions be made to
the written thesis to address these problems prior to granting its final approval.
External Examiner
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will request the external examiner to give, within three (3) weeks of the
distribution of the thesis, a detailed written report of the thesis and rate it either as a pass or a fail. The Dean of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies shall ensure the anonymity of the external examiner until their report has been received.
 If the external examiner passes the thesis, the student can proceed to oral defence.
 If the external examiner fails the thesis, the unit Head shall convene a meeting of the internal examining
committee and the student’s advisor/co-advisor to decide how to bring the thesis to an acceptable scholarly
standard. In normal circumstances, this will involve additional scholarly work. The unit Head will provide a
detailed written remediation plan to the advisor/co-advisor, the candidate. and the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies.
 If the external examiner fails a resubmitted thesis, this constitutes a second failure and the candidate is
required to withdraw from the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
The awarding of a passing grade by an external examiner does not preclude them from awarding a failing grade at a
subsequent stage in the examination process. The performance of a student at the oral examination may reveal
problems of comprehension or explanation, and the external examined may require revisions be made to the written
thesis to address these problems prior to granting final approval.
Reports

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
If advancement to the oral examination is approved, as outlined above, the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies
shall provide electronic copies of all reports to each of the advisor/co-advisor, examiners and Head of the unit.
5.12 The Oral Examination
5.12.1 Scheduling
Units cannot proceed with scheduling the oral defence prior to receiving the approved examiners report from the
Faculty of Graduate Studies. The examination must be held at The University of Manitoba. It is the responsibility of
the unit to ensure that all room booking arrangements are made and appropriate facilities meet minimum standards
expected for a Ph.D. defence. In addition, the candidate must submit, in electronic format biographical information
and an abstract of the thesis to the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.12.2 Attendance
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies or designate shall act as Chair of the examination committee.
The attendance of the external examiner in person at the candidate’s oral examination is encouraged. If the external
examiner will not be present in person, his/her participation via video conferencing is expected. If the external
examiner cannot participate electronically, he/she will be asked to provide questions in advance. These questions will
be read to the candidate at the defence by the Chair.
All internal members of the examining committee are required to be present at the defence, unless exceptional
circumstances prevent this. Under such circumstances, and with the prior approval of the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies, one internal member may participate via video conferencing. Consequently, no more than one
internal member and the external examiner may participate via video conferencing.
Under no circumstances can the candidate participate by video conferencing.
Normally, the oral examination shall be open to all members of The University of Manitoba community and the
general public. In exceptional cases the final oral examination may be closed; for example, when the results of the
thesis research must be kept confidential for a period of time. In such cases, the examination committee and Head of
the unit shall request prior approval in writing from the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. If approved, the final
oral examination shall be closed to all but the examining committee and the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies
or designate.
Regardless of open or closed status, no recording devices will be permitted.
5.12.3 Format of the Examination
The first part of the oral examination shall consist of an oral presentation by the candidate. This is followed by
examination of the candidate by the examination committee. If time permits the Chair, at their discretion, may allow
questions from members of the audience.
5.12.4 Procedures for the Conduct of the Examination
The Chair should discuss the examination procedures with the examiners in camera prior to the beginning of the
formal examination.
The Chair will introduce the candidate and request him/her to give a concise (20 to 25 minute) oral presentation of the
thesis to include a summary of the problem addressed, the results obtained, and the conclusions drawn from the
study.
Following the presentation, the Chair will invite questions from each member of the examining committee, taking care
to ensure that each examiner has approximately equal time for questions. The total time for questions by the
examining committee must not exceed two (2) hours.
The Chair may exercise his/her discretion in allowing questions from the audience following completion of the formal
examination. Once assuming the role of Chair, he/she foregoes the right to comment on the merits of the thesis
whether or not he/she is an expert in the field.
5.12.5 Decision of the Committee
Following completion of the formal examination, the candidate and audience must leave the examination room. The
decision of the examining committee will be based both on the content of the thesis and on the candidate's ability to
defend it. The performance of the candidateat the oral examination may reveal problems of comprehension or
explanation, and the examining committee may require revisions be made to the written thesis to address these
problems prior to granting final approval.

244

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18

The judgement of the examiners shall be reported by the Chair to the Faculty of Graduate Studies in the qualitative
terms “pass” or “fail” on the “Final Examination of the Ph.D. Thesis” form.
 Pass: the candidate has satisfactorily presented the thesis rationale, methodology, findings, and conclusions
to the general satisfaction of the examining committee. Notwithstanding this, stylistic, grammatical, and
content revisions to the thesis may be required. Normally, the advisor/co-advisor is charged with ensuring
that any revisions are satisfactorily completed. Under some circumstances, the entire examining committee
may wish to ensure any required revisions are completed satisfactorily. Regardless, those examiners in
agreement must indicate, by their signatures, concurrence with the passing grade.
 Fail: the candidate has failed to adequately orally present the thesis rationale, methodology, findings, and/or
conclusions, or to satisfactorily respond to questions posed related to the thesis. Failure may also arise
because of defects in conception, methodology, or context. Those examiners in agreement must indicate,
by his/her signature, concurrence with the failing grade.
If either the external examiner or two or more internal examiners indicate a fail, the candidate fails the examination. In
this case, the Chair must submit of a copy of the report, including written detailed reasons for the decision, to the
candidate, all members of the examining committee, and the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
In the case of a first failure of the oral defence, the candidate will have the opportunity to discuss the report with the
internal examining committee. If the thesis is revised, then it is strongly recommended that the candidate circulate it
to the members of the internal examining committee and obtain their informal approval to proceed to a second
distribution before doing so. A new copy of the thesis should be submitted directly to the Faculty of Graduate Studies
for distribution to the external examiner and examining committee within 3 months of the failed oral examination, in
preparation for a second and final oral examination. The candidate is already deemed to have passed the thesis
(Section 5.11.6); however, the examination during the oral defence shall be based on the revised document.
In the case of either a second failure of the oral defence, or the combination of a failure of the written thesis and the
oral defence, the candidate will be required to withdraw from the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.13 Candidate Awards
The examination committee may recommend in writing to the Faculty of Graduate Studies that the thesis is of
sufficient merit to receive an award.
5.14 Graduation
The candidate will be recommended for the Ph.D. degree upon receipt by the Faculty of Graduate Studies of
favourable reports by the thesis examining committee, a corrected copy of the electronic version of the thesis
submitted to MSpace, final approval and release forms, and providing all other degree requirements have been
satisfied.
Patents –Refer to section 6 “Policy of Withholding Theses Pending Patent Applications” in this Guide.
Restriction of Theses for Publication – In exceptional cases, not covered by the regulation concerning patents,
where adequate cause can be shown to delay publication, the student and advisor/co-advisor may request in writing
that the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies restrict access for a period up to one year after the submission of
the digital version of a thesis to The University of Manitoba. The Dean shall determine for what period, if any, access
will be so restricted.
Library and Archives Canada – Library and Archives Canada obtains a copy of the thesis via the University’s
MSpace repository.
5.15 Student Withdrawal
A student will be required to withdraw when the Ph.D. thesis has been rejected twice at the stage where:
a) The internal examining committee reports on the merits of the written thesis;
b) The external examiner reports on the merits of the written thesis;
c) The oral examination; or
d) A combination of any of these stages.

SECTION 6: Policy of Withholding Thesis Pending a Patent
Application Content or Manuscript Submission
SECTION 6: Policy of Withholding Thesis Pending Patent Applications Content or Manuscript Submission
In 1970, The University of Manitoba Board of Governors and Senate approved a policy on accepting research grants
from outside agencies. This policy defined the right of agencies to defer release of information and thus ensure
freedom of publications for research findings of University personnel. Occasionally, the University may also wish to
restrict the release of a thesis pending patent application. For additional details, see The University of Manitoba
governing document: http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/community/235.html
This situation may arise in the two circumstances defined below, both of which are governed by the same set of
regulations:
1. Where a research project is known to contain patentable items as defined in the research contract, then it is
the responsibility of the advisor/co-advisor to give written information of the restrictions on publication to the
student prior to the start of the thesis research. If the student agrees to carry out the research, then the
regulation given below will apply.
2. Where a patentable item is found during the course of research, then the advisor/co-advisor and the student
may make application for patent rights through the University Patent Committee, and the following regulation
will apply concerning the release of the thesis.
Regulations Concerning Release of a Thesis During Application and Negotiation For Patents
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will receive the approved thesis. On written joint request of the
advisor/co-advisor and the student, the Dean will retain the thesis for a period up to one year.
Regulations Concerning Release of Thesis Pending Manuscript Submission
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will receive the approved thesis. On written joint request of the advisor
and the student, the Dean will retain the thesis for a period up to one year.
In exceptional cases, not covered by the regulation concerning patents, where adequate causes can be shown to
delay publication, the student and advisor/co-advisor may request in writing that the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
studies restrict access for a period up to one year after submission of the digital version of a thesis or practicum to
The University of Manitoba. The Dean shall determine for what period, if any, access will be so restricted.

SECTION 7: Extension of Time to Complete Program of Study
SECTION 7: Extension of Time to Complete Program of Study Content
All requests for extensions will normally be dealt with administratively and reported, in summary form, to the
Executive Committee of Graduate Studies for information. The student must complete the "Time Extension Request
Form” http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html and submit it to his/her major unit for
recommendation to the Faculty of Graduate Studies at least three, but no more than four, months prior to
expiration of the respective maximum time limit. Requests for an extension are reviewed by the Faculty of Graduate
Studies on a case by case basis.
Requests for extension must be accompanied by a realistic detailed timeline that has been agreed to by the student
and advisor/co-advisor and endorsed by the unit Head. The extension time requested must closely reflect the time
required to complete the program.
The normal time granted for extensions is four to eight months. More than one extension period may be granted.
However the total approved for all extensions will not normally exceed one year.

SECTION 8: Leaves of Absence
8.1 Regular Leave
A regular leave is intended to allow students to meet responsibilities/plans related to family, travel or employment and
circumstances not covered by the parental or exceptional leaves. At the student’s request, the Head of the unit may
recommend to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies that a student be granted a leave of absence for a period
of time not to exceed one year. While on a regular leave of absence, a student is not expected to be actively engaged
in their program of study or thesis research work. A student on a regular leave of absence is required to maintain
continuous registration. A student on a regular leave of absence will not be assessed program fees, if any are owing,
during the period of the leave; however, the appropriate continuing fee will be assessed* Any program fees deferred
as a result of a regular leave will be assessed when the student returns from leave. A regular leave of absence status
does not extend time limits as outlined in Faculty of Graduate Studies regulations.
Note: At the time of approval of an application for leave, the procedures for the return of the student to the unit at the
completion of the leave must be stipulated.
*Program Fees: The continuing fee in effect at the time of the granting of the leave will be levied. However, if the
student returns from leave in January, the normal tuition fee will be levied less the continuing fee is already paid.
8.2 Exceptional Leave
In exceptional circumstances for medical or compassionate reasons (e.g. the need to care for an ailing family
member), at the request of the student, the Head of the unit may recommend to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies that a student be granted an exceptional leave of absence for a period of time not to exceed one year.
Supplemental documentation should support the requested dates of the leave. Exceptional leaves must correspond
with the start and end of (an) academic term(s). While on an exceptional leave of absence, a student is not permitted
to be engaged in their program of study thesis research work, and would not be required to maintain continuous
registration or pay tuition fees. In addition, the leave period would not be included in the time period allowed for the
completion of the degree. This leave is not intended to cover circumstances related to travel, employment, or financial
concerns.
Note: At the time of approval of an application for leave, the procedures for the return of the student to the unit at the
completion of the leave must be stipulated.
8.2.1 Fees
Students are not expected to pay fees for the term in which they have been granted an exceptional leave. Upon
return from the exceptional leave, students will be assessed fees as determined by the Registrar’s Office.
8.3 Parental Leave
A graduate student who is expecting a child or who has primary responsibility for the care of an infant or young child
immediately following a birth or adoption of a child is eligible for parental leave. The request for a parental leave
should be made through the unit, to the Faculty of Graduate Studies for a period of time not to exceed one year.
Parental leaves must correspond with the start and end of (an) academic term(s). While on leave of absence for
parental reasons, a student is not permitted to be engaged in their program of study or thesis research work. The
leave period is not included in the time period allowed for completion of the degree.
Note: At the time of approval of an application for leave, the procedures for the return of the student to the unit at the
completion of the leave must be stipulated.
8.3.1 Fees
Students are not expected to pay fees for the term in which they have been granted a parental leave. Upon return
from the parental leave students will be assessed fees as determined by the Registrar’s Office.
All applications for Leaves of Absence must be submitted on the “Leave of Absence Form” available at:

SECTION 9: Appeals – Procedures And Guidelines
9.1 General
Students who disagree with a decision have access to appeal routes as laid out by various Faculty of Graduate
Studies and University of Manitoba appeal procedures. Student appeals may be limited by the scope of the inquiry
available at each level and category of appeal, as well as by the time limitations for submission of appeals.
A further limitation is that the Faculty of Graduate Studies rules and regulations, established to uphold the academic
rigour of The University of Manitoba, are generally not subject to appeal unless an appeal route is otherwise
stipulated. In situations where no appeal route is available, a student may make a written request to the Dean of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Students are referred to the appeals section of The University of Manitoba Governing Documents
(http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/index.html) for further details.
For students registered in Joint Master's Programs (University of Manitoba and University of Winnipeg) there is a
different process for handling appeals and academic dishonesty cases than for University of Manitoba students in
regular programs (not Joint Programs). This process is outlined in the Joint Master's Program Governing Documents
available at http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/media/JMP_Regulations.pdf.
9.2 Definitions
 “Appellant” – the graduate student appealing a decision affecting the student’s own admission to, academic
standing in, awards from, or disciplinary action by a unit or the Faculty of Graduate Studies;
 “Appeal Panel” – a panel convened from the members of the Faculty of Graduate Studies Appeals
Committee by the Executive Committee of the Faculty of Graduate Studies empowered to deal with appeals
stemming from decisions of units or the Faculty of Graduate Studies, or individuals designated to make such
decisions;
 “Unit” – the unit council, or appeal body, whose decision is being appealed. This is understood to include
decisions taken by individuals or committees acting in the name of the unit and also to the supplementary
regulations pertinent to a unit’s operation which have been approved by the Faculty of Graduate Studies;
 “Respondent” – a representative of the unit or the Faculty of Graduate Studies designated by the unit
Head/Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies to represent the unit or Faculty of Graduate Studies.
9.3 Types of Appeal
There are several areas of appeal which are open to appellants:
 admission;
 academic;
 discipline;
 administration (e.g. Fee appeals).
In all cases, appeals should be directed to the Dean of the faculty of Graduate Studies. A decision of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies Appeal Panel is appealable only to the Senate Committee on Appeals or the University Discipline
Committee, as appropriate. In all cases an appellant shall have the option of being registered in, and undertaking the
responsibilities of, his/her program, until such time as he/she has exhausted the university appeal process or the
appellant decides not to appeal further, whichever comes first.

(e.g., qualifying examinations, candidacy examinations, thesis proposals, thesis examinations), only after
they have been dealt with by the appropriate unit-level appeal process (if any), as outlined in its
supplementary regulations;
stemming from a decision of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.

In all cases, appeals should be directed to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. A decision of the Appeal
Panel is appealable only to the Senate Committee on Appeals (see
http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/students/senate_committee_on_appeals_policy.html
9.5.3 Grounds for an Academic Appeal

The thesis/practicum should be written in a standard style manual that has been recommended by the unit. Manuals
recommended by the Faculty of Graduate Studies include but are not limited to:
 American Psychological Association, Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association;
 Kate L. Turabian, A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses and Dissertations;
 The Modern Language Association of America, MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers;
 University of Chicago Press, The Chicago Manual of Style;
Students should always use the latest edition available. If there is a conflict between the instructions in this booklet
and the style manual chosen, the former should be followed.
1.2.2 Spelling
Canadian, British or American spelling is acceptable, but one style must be used consistently throughout the
document.
1.2.3 Format
Double space all text material; footnotes and long quotations may be single spaced. The entire thesis/practicum must
be in the same text font, style, and size. Font size should be no less than 12 pt Times Roman. Full justification of the
text is not required.
1.2.4 Margins
It is imperative that the specified margins be observed throughout the thesis/practicum. Leave at least a one inch
(1.0”) margin from the top, bottom, left, and right hand edges of the paper. These margins apply to all material,
including appendices, diagrams, maps, photographs, charts, tables, etc.
1.2.5 Page Numbers
Each page in the thesis/practicum must be numbered consecutively. Illustrative pages and appendices must also be
numbered. Roman numerals should be used for the prefatory pages. The remaining pages of the thesis/practicum,
beginning with the introduction (Chapter One) should be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals.
1.3 Footnotes, References and Appendices
Instructions in the style manual recommended by the unit should be followed. Regardless of which style manual is
used, format selected must be consistent.
1.4 Figures, Illustrations, Photographs and Design Drawings
1.4.1 Illustrative Material
All illustrative material must be consistent throughout the thesis/practicum. All figures, illustrations, photographs and
drawings must be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals and accompanied with a title. The material should
appear as soon as possible after as it is mentioned in the text. All original materials should be of high quality, with
sharp and clear images.
1.4.2 Layout of Tables and Figures
Each table and figure must have a number and title. The number and title should appear at the top of the table or
figure. The title of the table or figure should be as short as possible and indicate the major focus of the material within
the table or figure.
1.5 Additional Materials
1.5.1 Consent and Access to Information Forms
Sample copies of consent forms that were used to obtain consent from participants to take part in the information
gathering procedures for the thesis/practicum must be included in an Appendix. Any personal information must be
omitted from the submitted form.
In some cases, approval from an agency, institution or corporation may have been required before the information
gathering procedures could proceed. The original approval form for access should be retained by the student with a
copy provided to the Faculty of Graduate Studies upon completion of the thesis/practicum.
1.5.2 Use of Copyrighted Material
If the thesis/practicum includes copyrighted material (images or more than a reasonable extract (according to the
Copyright Act) of another person’s work), permission must be obtained from the copyright holder. A “Sample
Permission Letter” is available on the Copyright Office website
(http://umanitoba.ca.admin.vp_admin/ofp/copyright/index.html)
In some cases, copyright holders prefer to use their own permission forms and/or will provide their permission

257

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
electronically. Both of these are acceptable by the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Note that obtaining permission may take a considerable amount of time and this must be taken into consideration
when meeting a thesis/practicum submission deadline. A reference to written permission having been obtained must
be included under the image or text. The reference should also include the date the permission was granted, and the
name/title of the copyright holder(s). The original form(s) signed by the copyright holders should be retained by the
student with a copy provided to the Faculty of Graduate Studies at the completion of the thesis/practicum.
The thesis/practicum cannot be accepted by the Faculty of Graduate Studies if permission has not been obtained. It
is important that the student and their advisor ensure that the permission has been granted. In some cases, the
copyright holder cannot be located or the cost is prohibitive to using the text or image. In these situations, the text or
image may have to be omitted from the thesis/practicum.
Subsequently, information on where the reader can locate the image or text should be included, such as the URL,
title of book/journal, volume and issue number, page number, publisher, and date of publication. A description of the
purpose or significance of the text or image should be provided.
For further information on copyright see: http://umanitoba.ca/admin/vp_admin/ofp/copyright/index.html
2.0 Manuscript/Grouped Manuscript Style
A thesis/practicum may comprise a paper, or collection of papers, which are, or are about to be, published. The
number of papers that comprise this style of thesis/practicum will be determined between the student and the
advisory committee. The formatting of the thesis/practicum must be consistent throughout the thesis/practicum and
the thesis/practicum cannot merely consist of several papers or articles bound within the one document.
Publication, or acceptance for publication, of research results prior to the presentation of the thesis/practicum does
not supersede the evaluation of the work by the examination committee (i.e. does not guarantee that the
thesis/practicum will be found acceptable). Examiners may specify revisions regardless of the publication status.
The thesis/practicum must follow the same prefatory information (1.1), spelling, formatting margin requirements, page
numbering (1.2), footnotes and appendices (1.3), figures, illustrations photographs and drawings (1.4) and any
additional material (1.5) as those outlined above.
There must be an introductory chapter to the entire thesis/practicum which includes its own bibliography. The
collection of papers or articles must contribute toward the overall theme that represents the thesis/practicum work
and must be smoothly integrated into the flow of the thesis/practicum to produce a unified document. This may
require changes or additions to, and re-writing of, any work which has been previously published.
The thesis/practicum must contain connecting text between the different chapters providing logical links to allow the
integration of the information. These connecting sections are mandatory. Not including these sections may
compromise the ability of the examiners to evaluate the thesis/practicum and accordingly there may be subsequent
potential consequences.
The thesis/practicum must contain a concluding chapter that includes a discussion on how the thesis/practicum, with
its findings, provides a distinct contribution to knowledge in the research area.
In the case of multi-authored papers, the nature and extent of the student/candidate’s contribution, and those of the
other authors, must be explicitly specified in a section entitled "Contributions of Authors" in the “Preface” of the
thesis/practicum. The advisor/co-advisor, by signing the thesis/practicum submission form, attests to the accuracy of
these statements and will be asked to reaffirm at the oral defence in the case of a doctoral thesis.

The Faculty of Graduate Studies Aacademic Gguide contains all the rules and policies pertaining to the Faculty of
Graduate Studies. Adherence to these rules is of utmost importance for the effective functioning/operation of
programs and for guiding and monitoring the progress of students. The integrity of the process is at stake. The major
goal of this guide is to prevent potential problems that may affect the completion of a student’s program. It is the
responsibility of students and the unit offering a graduate program to read and follow the policies contained herein.
All regulations as laid out in the Faculty of Graduate Studies Academic Guide are subject to revision by the
appropriate bodies of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. This compendium is presented as the most recent set of
regulations as a guideline for students and staff. Regulations may vary from one department or program to another.
Individual departments may have additional regulations that supplement these general regulations. All such
supplementary procedures and regulations must be approved as specified by the By-Laws of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies, be published and available to students, and kept on file in the Faculty of Graduate Studies Office.
For those programs that are administered through a Faculty (as opposed to a Department) the term “Department”
should be substituted by “Unit” within this document ( i.e. Department Head becomes Unit Head.)

262

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
The minimum standard for acceptance into any category in the Faculty of Graduate Studies is a 3.0 Grade Point
Average (GPA) or equivalent in the last two previous years of full time university study (60 credit hours).
Note: This is the minimum requirement of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and units may have higher standards
and additional criteria.

1.1.12 Eligibility of University of Manitoba Staff Members
A staff member at The University of Manitoba at the rank of Assistant Professor or above is not eligible to apply
for admission to a graduate program in the unit in which the appointment is held.

1.2 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES
1.2.1 Registration
Undergraduate and pre-Master’s students are not allowed to register in graduate courses. Pre-Master's students
are not allowed to register in 7000-level courses or above, with the exception of GRAD 7500.; that is, admission to
the Faculty of Graduate Studies is a condition for registration in courses at the 6000 level and above.
All graduate students must initially register in the term specified in their letter of acceptance as specified
in the Academic Schedule of the Graduate Calendar. Any student not registering by the registration deadline
for
the term specified in their letter of offer will be required to re-apply for admission. In exceptional circumstances
and with prior approval from the unit, a student may defer registration for up to one term following acceptance
into
the Faculty of Graduate Studies. In the case of international students, admission may be deferred, with prior
approval from the unit, for up to one year following acceptance.
All programs must be approved by the Head of the major unit or designate. Approval to take courses from
units outside the major unit must be obtained from the outside unit.
The approval or denial of admission and registration to two programs rests with the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies in consultation with the unit concerned. The approval/denial must be submitted to the Faculty of
Graduate Studies prior to the student’s admission/registration on the “Concurrent Curriculum Permission” form
(http://intranet.umanitoba.ca/student/records/2323.html).
Where a student does register in two programs, the student must declare themself as part-time in at least one of
it is important to note the programs. Students should note that dual registration may affect funding, and that
completing a graduate program as a part-time student will affect their eligibility for The University of Manitoba
Graduate Fellowship (UMGF) and
may limit other funding possibilities.

1.2.2 Re-Registration
Anyll students whose program of study extends for more than one year must re-register in all the succeeding fall,
winter and summer terms of each succeeding year term of his/her program until a degree is obtained (with the
exception or in the case of pre-Master’s students, their program is completed). Failure to re-register will result
in the student being discontinuedation of from his/her graduate programstatus. A student who has been
discontinued and would like to be
considered for continuation in a program must apply for re-admission, which is
not guaranteed. The re-registration requirement does not apply to occasional students, visiting students, preMaster’s students, or students on an
Exceptional or Parental Leave of Absence (please refer to “Leave of
Absence”, Section 8 of this Guide).
The notation ‘Discontinued Graduate Program’ will be placed on the academic record of any graduate student
who has failed to maintain continuous registration.

1.2.3 Registration Revisions
For designated periods subsequent to registration, approved revisions may be made. It is required that students
adhere to dates and deadlines as published in the Academic Schedule of the Graduate Academic Calendar.
Note: Graduate students are not permitted to withdraw from courses without written permission from their unit
Head on recommendation from their advisor/co-advisor (and/or advisory committee). The notation “Required to
Withdraw” may will be placed on the academic record of any graduate student who has withdrawn from courses
without such approval.

1.2.4 Advisor Student Guidelines

263

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
All students in thesis/practicum programs, in consultation with their advisor/co-advisor, are required to complete
the Advisor Student Guidelines as soon as possible after registration but no later than at the time of submission of
the first Progress Report. The Advisor Student Guidelines form is available through JUMP.
1.2.5 Western Deans’ Agreement
This agreement was established in 1974 as an expression of co-operation and mutual support among universities
offering graduate programs in western Canada. Its primary purpose is the reciprocal enrichment of graduate
programs throughout western Canada. This agreement is not intended to preclude other agreements between
participating institutions. A list of the participating Universities can be found at http://wcdgs.ca/
1.2.5.1 The Western Deans’ Agreement normally provides an automatic tuition fee waiver for visiting students.
Graduate students paying normal required tuition fees to their home institution will not pay tuition fees to
the host institution.
1.2.5.2 Only degree level courses from recognized post-secondary institutions will be considered; courses that
are part of certificate or diploma programs will not be approved.
1.2.5.3 Program fees are always to be paid to the home institution, regardless of coursework taken at another
institution. Students may be required to pay student, activity, application, or other ancillary fees to the
host institution, according to general policies in effect at the host institution. Wherever possible, these
fees will also be waived.
1.2.5.4 Students will qualify for the fee waiver if they:
a) present the “Authorization Form: Western Deans’ Agreement” signed by the Dean or designate and the unit
Head or advisor/co-advisor of a participating Western institution at least one (1) month prior to the start of
term, specifying the courses to be taken for credit toward a graduate degree program at their home institution;
b) are in good standing in a graduate program at the home institution;
c) do not owe tuition and/or fees have paid all current and back fees at the home institution.
1.2.5.5 Students must meet all requirements as prescribed by the host university’s regulations, deadlines, class
capacities, and course prerequisites.
1.2.5.6 Registration is possible in courses at both the graduate and undergraduate levels, and in credit courses
offered through distance education or other means. To be eligible, courses must be an integral part of
the applicant’s graduate degree program. Fee waiver is not permitted for audit or non-credit courses.
1.2.5.7 Students must have the Authorization Form approved by the relevant unit Head and the Faculty of
Graduate Studies at the host institution at least one (1) month two weeks prior to the commencement of
the course(s) requested. The fee waiver is not available retroactively.
1.2.5.8 Students are subject to regulations of the home institution governing credit for the courses to be
undertaken. As a condition of registration at the host institution, students will arrange for official
transcripts from the host institution to be sent to the home institution confirming successful completion of
courses selected.
1.2.5.9 Students must send confirmation of registration and notice of any change to the Registrar's Office of the
home institution at the time of registration or course change is completed.
1.2.5.10 Students may not claim fee waivers under the terms of this Agreement for a period of more than 12
months in total.
1.2.5.11 Each institution has its own regulations regarding the maximum number of transfer credits permitted in a
given degree program. A list of the participating Universities can be found at http://wcdgs.ca/

1.3 COURSE CLASSIFICATIONS

264

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
1.3.1 General Classifications
Students who register through Aurora Student Information System (Aurora Student) must also have prior approval
of the unit Head or designate. Students registering through Aurora Student should add only those courses that are
a Major (Standard "S") course in their program. Courses with Auxiliary “X”, Audit “A”, or Occasional “O” status
(see below) must be added by the unit.
“X” Auxiliary course: Course is not a major requirement of the program but is required by the student’s advisor/coadvisor.** Extra courses that are not part of the Master’s or Ph.D. program but which are specified and required
by the student’s advisor/co-advisor, may be classified as X (Auxiliary) and the grade will not be included in the
degree GPA which appears on the transcript. However, X course grades may be used in the calculation of the
GPA for continuation in the program and a minimum grade requirement may be required for X coursework by the
unit. (Please consult the individual unit’s supplemental regulations.) Additionally, X courses are used in the
calculation of the GPA for the purposes of Admission and Awards. (The University of Manitoba Graduate
Fellowship [(UMGF]) and International Graduate Student Scholarship ([IGSS]) use X courses in the calculation of
the GPA.) The student’s advisor/co-advisor and unit Head must determine if there is a valid need for the
registration in courses under the X classification. A maximum of 12 credit hours under the X course
classification is permitted while registered in a given program.
“A” Audit course: Course is not taken for credit. No grade is recorded. Additional fees will be assessed.
“O” Occasional course: Course is not a requirement of the program. Additional fees will be assessed.
** Note: Changes in course classifications are regarded as course/program changes and may not be made
without approval (refer to the “Registration Revision” section of this Guide) or after the deadline dates for course
changes as indicated in the Academic Schedule of the Calendar.

1.3.2 Continuing Courses (CO)
For those graduate level courses (6000, 7000, and 8000) which are being taken by students enrolled in the
Faculty of Graduate Studies and which continue beyond the normal academic term, the instructor shall
recommend that a mark classification of “CO” be used until such time as a final grade can be established. If the
course is not completed by August 31, the student must re-register for the course(s).
In the absence of an assigned mark of “CO”, the student may receive a mark of “F” in that term.
Note: A CO will normally not be permitted longer than twelve months. In exceptional circumstances, where a CO
grade is requested for a second twelve months, at the time the CO grade is submitted, the instructor and unit
Head must also submit the “Recommendation for Continuing Status of a Course” form stating the reason for the
CO and the deadline by which the course must be completed.
1.3.3 Incomplete Courses
Students who are unable to complete the term work prescribed in a course may apply to the instructor prior to the
end of term for consideration of a grade classification of “Incomplete”. It is understood that the student is to write
the final examination if one is scheduled for the course. Taking into account the results of the final examination,
the value of the term work completed, and the extent of the incomplete term work, the instructor shall calculate the
temporary grade using a zero value for incomplete work.
Normally, the following maximum extensions are allowed:
st
 August 1 for courses terminated in April
st
 December 1 for courses terminated in August
st
 April 1 for courses terminated in December
If a final grade is not reported within one month of the extension deadline, the Incomplete (I) classification will be
dropped and the grade will remain as awarded. The student will no longer have an opportunity to improve the
grade. In no case will the satisfaction of the incomplete requirements result in a lower grade being awarded.

1.4 STUDENT STATUS/CATEGORIES OF STUDENTS
1.4.1 Full-Time and Part-Time Students
Graduate students are initially admitted with full time status unless a “Part-Time Status Form”
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html) has been received. who are participating in
studies on a regular basis in an academic term and/or are registered in the academic year are considered to be

265

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
full-time students. Graduate student status is not determined by the number of credit hours taken per term.
Therefore, such students who spend much of the time in a laboratory or library engaged in research or writing a
thesis/practicum, or who spend part of the academic year engaged in research elsewhere, are regarded as fulltime students.
Student status should be determined by the student and advisor/co-advisor, and changes must be requested on
the “Part-Time Status FormChange of Status” form
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). The form must be approved by the unit Head
and submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Declaration of full/part time status must be made prior to the end of the registration revision period in the Fall
and/or Winter terms and within one month of the start of the Summer term.
For every full year (twelve months) a Master’s student is declared as part time they will receive an additional four
months in time to complete their program. For every two years (24 months) a Master’s student is declared as part
time they will receive an additional year (12 months) in time to complete their program. For every two years (24
months) a Ph.D. student is declared as part time they will receive an additional four months in time to complete
their program. Retroactive status changes will not be made.
1.4.2 Pre-Master’s Or Qualifying Students
In specific cases where the academic background of the student is judged to be insufficient for the given program
in a unit, the unit may recommend that the student be admitted to a pre-Master’s program of study. The preMaster’s program is intended to bring the student’s standing to approximately the level of an Honours graduate in
the major unit, and to provide any necessary prerequisites for courses.

1.4.3 Occasional Students
A student wishing to take graduate courses with no intention of applying them toward an advanced degree at The
University of Manitoba is classified as an occasional student. Occasional students must meet the same degree
and grade point average entrance requirements as regular graduate students and must write final examinations in
the courses taken (unless audited), but will not receive credit toward a degree. In special circumstances, an
occasional student may apply for permission to proceed to a degree program and also apply for transfer, for
credit, of courses previously taken in the occasional category.
Note:
1. Transfer of courses from the “occasional” category to a degree program is not automatic: request for
advance credit must be made within the first year of a degree program.
2. Fees paid by a student while registered as an occasional student are not transferable, at a later date, to a
degree program.
3. Registration in the occasional student category can be for no more than one academic year without
reapplication.
4. At least 60% of coursework per academic year must be taken at the graduate level while registered as an
occasional student.

1.4.4 Joint Masters (With the University of Winnipeg)
The University of Manitoba and the University of Winnipeg offer four joint Master’s programs: History, Religion,
Public Administration, and Peace and Conflict Studies. The University of Manitoba Faculty of Graduate Studies is
responsible for the administration of the joint programs, and students must complete the regular University of
Manitoba application and registration forms. Students taking pre-Master’s qualifying work for these programs
register at the university where the courses are being taken.

1.4.5 Visiting Students
Visiting students are students who are registered at another institution who are taking one or more courses at The
University of Manitoba on a Letter of Permission from their home university. Visiting students must submit an
online application, along with a $100.00 (CDN) application fee, in addition to copies of transcripts from all
institutions attended and a successfully completed English Language Proficiency Test from the approved list, if
applicable. Applications must be submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies a minimum of one (1) month prior
to the start of the intended term of study.

266

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18

Note:
1. Fees paid by a student while registered as a visiting student are not transferable, at a later date, to a degree

SECTION 2: Academic Performance – General
2.1 GENERAL NOTE
Students are ultimately responsible for ensuring that they meet all degree and program requirements. The
advisor (and if appropriate co-advisor), advisory committee, and unit must ensure that each student follows FGS and
Unit the guidelines and meets all the program requirements. The Faculty of Graduate Studies performs a final check
of program Faculty of Graduate Studies minimum requirements for each student just prior to graduation. Students are
cautioned, therefore, to periodically check all regulations with respect to their degree requirements. Failure to meet all
the requirements will render a student ineligible to graduate.
Units may make recommendations with respect to the regulations concerning minimum academic performance;
however, enforcement of academic regulations rests with the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The following procedures
apply to recommendations made by units:
The unit is responsible for informing the Faculty of Graduate Studies when a student’s performance is unsatisfactory
in research or coursework and the unit must outline any recommended remedial action(s).
The unit must notify the student of the deficiency and of its recommendation.
If the student fails to satisfy any remedial action recommended, the student may be required to withdraw from the
Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Note: When a graduate student is required to withdraw from a program of study, the notation on the academic record
will be: “Required to withdraw”.
A student who has been required to withdraw from a graduate program may be permitted to apply for admission to
another graduate program only if the application for admission is approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies.
Voluntary withdrawal from a program is only permitted if the student is in good academic standing.
Recommendations of units will supersede student requests for voluntary withdrawal.

2.2 BONAFIDE ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS (BFAR)
The following Bona Fide Academic Requirements (BFAR) represent the core academic requirements a graduate
student must acquire in order to gain, and demonstrate acquisition of, essential knowledge and skills. Students must

university study will be considered for admission to a pre-Master’s program. These are the minimum requirements of
the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Units may specify higher or additional criteria. Admission to a pre-Master’s program
does not guarantee future admission to a Master’s program. As the pre-Master’s program of study is intended to bring
a student’s background up to the equivalent of the required 4-year degree, units should assign to students, as part of
their pre-Master’s program of study, an appropriate number of applicable upper level (3000 or 4000) undergraduate
courses. Graduate-level Ccourses at the (7000 level or above) cannot be taken in a pre-Master’s program. Courses
taken as part of the pre-Master’s program may not be transferred to a Master’s program at a later date.

3.2 ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE
3.2.1. The unit Head is responsible for assigning the courses and monitoring the progress of each student.
3.2.2. A minimum degree grade point average of 3.0 with no grade below C+ must be maintained to continue in a
pre-Master’s program. Students who fail to maintain this standing will be required to withdraw unless remedial action
recommended by the unit (as described below) is approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
3.2.3. Students deficient in 6 hours of credit or less may be permitted to write a supplemental examination (when
offered in the unit’s supplemental regulations) in courses in which a grade of C or less was obtained.
3.2.4. Students deficient in 6 hours of credit or less with a grade of C, D, or F in a course or courses may be
permitted, if the overall average is C or better, to write one supplemental examination in each course (when offered
permitted byin the unit’s supplemental regulations), to repeat the courses, or to take equivalent substitute courses.
Note: In exceptional circumstances, when a student is deficient in more than 6 credit hours, the student may be
permitted to repeat the pre-Master’s year, or to write supplemental examinations (when offered), or to substitute
equivalent coursework in order to make up the deficiencies.
A student may be permitted to repeat the pre-Master’s year only once, and to remove deficiencies in grades by
writing a supplemental examination or repeating courses only a maximum of once for each course to a maximum of 9
credit hours of coursework.
If a course is repeated or a supplemental examination is written, the most recent grade obtained in that course will be
used in the determination of the degree GPA.
The degree GPA is cumulative in a pre-Master’s program if more than one year is required to complete the course
requirements.
A summary of all All action taken administratively is to be reported in summary form to the Faculty of Graduate
Studies Executive Committee.

Individual units may have additional specific requirements for graduation and students should consult unit
supplemental regulations for these specific requirements.
4.8.1 Thesis/Practicum Route
4.8.1.1 Thesis vs. Practicum
Students must demonstrate their mastery of the field and that they are fully conversant with the relevant literature
through their thesis/practicum.
A practicum differs from the thesis in its emphasis on the application of theory, it is however similar in scope, span,
and rigour. The rigour required for the practicum is equal to that required for the thesis. The practicum takes the form
of an exercise in the practical application of knowledge and skill. It usually involves the careful definition of a problem,
the application of appropriate knowledge and skills to the problem, and a report of the results in a manner suitable for
evaluation by an examining committee. Individual units have specific requirements for graduation and students
should consult unit supplemental regulations for specific requirements.
The thesis is developed under the mentorship of the advisor/co-advisor. Individual units may have specific guidelines
regarding the thesis proposal and its acceptance by the student’s advisory committee/unit Head; students should
consult unit supplemental regulations for specific requirements. Research must be approved by the appropriate
Human Research Ethics Board or Animal Care Committee, if applicable, before the work has begun on the thesis
research.
4.8.1.2 Examining Committee
The advisor/co-advisor will recommend an examining committee to the unit Head for approval, which shall then be
reported to the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the “Master’s Thesis/Practicum Title and Appointment of Examiners”
form (http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). This form must be approved by the Dean of
the Faculty of Graduate Studies at least two weeks prior to the distribution of the thesis.
Under normal circumstances, the examining committee will be the same as the advisory committee unless otherwise
stipulated in the unit’s Ssupplemental regulations. The examining committee must consist of a minimum of three
members (including the advisor/co-advisor), two of whom must be members of the Faculty of Graduate Studies, one
of whom must hold an primary appointment from within the unit, and one of whom must hold no appointment within
the unit. All examiners must be deemed qualified by the unit Head and be willing to serve. It is expected that, under
normal circumstances, Examination Committee members will have a Master's degree or equivalent. The composition
of, and any changes to, the examining committee, including the advisor/co-advisor, must be approved by the Faculty
of Graduate Studies. Individual units require establish specific requirements for examination and students should
consult unit supplemental regulations for specific requirements.
The Head of the unit arranges for the distribution of the thesis/practicum to the examiners. It is the duty of all
examiners to read the thesis/practicum and report on its merits according to the following categories:
 Acceptable, without modification or with minor revision(s); or
 Acceptable, subject to modification and/or revision(s); or
 Not acceptable.
If two or more examiners do not approve the thesis, then the student is deemed to have failed the distribution.
4.8.1.3 Oral Examination
For units requiring students to pass an oral examination on the subject of the thesis/practicum and matters relating
thereto, the format of the oral examination is described in the supplementary regulations of the unit. Students should
consult these supplemental regulations for specific requirements. A student has the right to an examination of the
thesis/practicum if he/she believes it is ready for examination. It is the unit’s responsibility to warn advise the student
of any risk involved should he/she decide to proceed against the unit’s recommendation.
All members of the examining committee should be present at the examination. If an examining committee member
cannot attend the defence, prior approval must be obtained from the Faculty of Graduate studies for the defence to
proceed. Under no circumstances can the student participate by video conferencing. Regardless of open or closed
status, no No recording devices will be permitted.
The oral examination shall be open to all members of The University of Manitoba community except in exceptional
cases. The oral examination may be closed, for example, when the results of the thesis/practicum research must be
kept confidential for a period of time. In such cases, the examining committee and unit Head shall recommend such
action to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies who shall then decide whether to grantapprove that the final
examination be closed to all but the examining committee and the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.

276

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18

Following completion of the examination of the thesis/practicum, examiners will consider the oral examination and the
written thesis/practicum.
The examiners will also determine the nature of and procedures for approval of any revisions that will be required
prior to submission of the thesis/practicum to the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The advisor/co-advisor is normally
responsible for ensuring that revisions are completed according to the instructions from the examining committee.
The judgement of the examiners shall be reported to the Faculty of Graduate Studies in the qualitative terms
“approved” or “not approved” on the “tThesis/practicum final report” form
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). Each examiner must indicate his/her opinion by
his/her signature. If two or more examiners do not approve the thesis, then the student is deemed to have failed the
defence.
The examining committee may recommend to the Faculty of Graduate Studies that the thesis is of sufficient merit to
receive an award.
4.8.1.4 Failure
In the case of a failure of the thesis/practicum at the Master’s level, a detailed written report will be prepared by the
Chair of the examination committee and submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies, who will make the report
available to the student and advisor/co-advisor.
A student will be required to withdraw when the thesis/practicum has been rejected twice at the stage where:
 The examining committee reports on the merits of the written thesis;
 The defence; or
 A combination of both stages.



The examining process should be completed within one month of distribution of the thesis/practicum.
4.8.2 Course-based or /Comprehensive Examination Route
Students must demonstrate his/her mastery of their field. The specific procedures for evaluation of this mastery are
stated in individual units’ supplemental regulations. Students should consult the unit’s supplemental regulations for
specific requirements.
In those units where comprehensive examinations are required, students should consult the unit’s supplemental
regulations for specific requirements. The results of the comprehensive examinations shall be submitted to the
Faculty of Graduate Studies on the “Report on Ccomprehensive Eexamination” form
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html) in the terms "pass" or "fail." No student may sit
comprehensive examinations more than twice. Any student who receives a "fail" on the comprehensive examination
twice will be required to withdraw from the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
4.9 Style and Format
The thesis/practicum must be written according to a standard style acknowledged by a particular field of study (see
Appendix 1).
4.10 Deadlines for Graduation
The final requirements of the degree, in the form of the final report on the thesis/practicum (and the corrected copy of
the thesis/practicum); comprehensive examination; or M. Eng. project,; or Ddesign thesis, must be submitted to the
Faculty of Graduate Studies by the appropriate deadline. For those programs that do not have a culminating exercise
(thesis/practicum/comprehensive examination/M.Eng. project/Design thesis) the unit must forward potential graduate
names to the Faculty of Graduate Studies by the deadline. The deadline for each of the graduation dates is published
on the Faculty of Graduate Studies website at umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/deadlines/index.html.

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18

SECTION 5: Doctor of Philosophy General Regulations
SECTION 5: Doctor of Philosophy General Regulations
The degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) is granted only upon evidence of general proficiency and of distinctive
attainment in a special field. In particular, the candidate must demonstrate an ability for independent investigation,
original research or creative scholarship. This is expected to be presented in a thesis with a degree of literary skill
and by an oral examination wherein the candidate exhibits mastery of their field. The Ph.D. is a research degree and
is not conferred by The University of Manitoba solely as a result of coursework study.
Although general regulations apply to all students, individual units may have additional regulations that supplement
these general regulations. All such supplemental regulations must be approved (as specified by the By-Laws of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies), be published and available to students
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/admin/supplemental_regulations.html), and be kept on record in the
Faculty of Graduate Studies. All students should consult unit supplemental regulations for specific details regarding
admission, program requirements, progression, and completion.
5.1 Admission
5.1.1 General criteria
Normally, the completion of a Master’s degree or equivalent from a recognized university and a cumulative GPA of
3.0 or equivalent in the last two previous years of full time university study (60 credit hours) is the minimum
requirement for admission to the Ph.D. program. Note: This is the minimum requirement of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies and units may have higher standards and additional criteria. However, the criteria for admissions into the
Ph.D. program are more stringent than for Masters’ programs; therefore, the completion of a Master’s program does
not guarantee admission into the Ph.D. program. Some units require completion of a thesis-based Master’s program
prior to admission to a Ph.D. program.
5.1.2 Direct Admission from the Bachelor’s Honours or equivalent
With special recommendation of the unit concerned, applicants with an honours Bachelor’s degree or equivalent may
be considered for entry to Ph.D. study. These students must be outstanding in their academic background (GPA well
above 3.0 in the last two full years of undergraduate study). Note: This is the minimum requirement of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies and units may have higher standards and additional criteria. Once admitted, these students must
complete at least 24 credit hours of coursework, unless the individual unit’s approved supplemental regulations
specify otherwise, and will be assessed Ph.D. fees for 3 years.
5.1.3 Transfer from the Master’s to the Ph.D. program
Students who have not completed a Master’s program may transfer to the Ph.D. program within the same unit upon
the recommendation by the Head of the unit to the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The recommendation should be
made within 18 months4 terms (including summer term) from of the start of student’s commencement of the Master’s
program. The coursework completed and time spent in the Master’s program will normally be credited towards the
Ph.D. program. Students must complete at least 24 credit hours of coursework, unless the individual unit’s approved
supplemental regulations specify otherwise.
The request to transfer from a Master’s to the Ph.D. program must be submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies at
least one month prior to the term for which the student intends to commence the Ph.D. program. The following are
required when making the request: The online Application for Admission indicating a request for transfer. If the
transfer is made within one year, no additional application fee must be paid. In the case where the student does not
hold a Master’s degree, a letter of recommendation from the Head of the unit is also required.
If the transfer occurs within 12 months of the initial registration in the Master’s program, the student will be assessed
Ph.D. fees for 3 years. If the transfer occurs after 12 months, the student will be assessed Ph.D. program fees for 2
years (as they will have already paid fees for the Master’s program). Students are cautioned that such transfers may
impact on The University of Manitoba Graduate Fellowship duration.
Where a student with a Master’s degree or equivalent is initially admitted and registered in a Master’s program, that
student may be transferred to the Ph.D. program within the same unit on the recommendation of the student’s
advisor/co-advisor and Head of the unit, provided that follow up transfer recommendation occurs within 12 months of
the initial registration in the Master’s program. In such a case, the application fee is waived and fees assessed
towards the Master’s program will be deducted from the full 2 years of Ph.D. program fees. Transfers later than 12
months must pay an application fee and their fees will be assessed as a 3 year Ph.D.
5.1.4 Provisional Admission to the Ph.D.

279

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
Students nearing the completion of the Master’s degree may be accepted provisionally to the Ph.D. program for a 12
month period (commencing with the first registration in the Ph.D. program). Further registration in the Ph.D. program
is contingent upon completion of all requirements of the Master’s degree within the 12 months. Students must
maintain continuous registration in their Master’s program until its completion. Students will require assistance from
the unit and the Faculty of Graduate Studies to complete dual registration on the “Concurrent Curriculum Permission”
form (http://intranet.umanitoba.ca/student/records/2323.html)
in the Master’s and Ph.D. program simultaneously.
5.1.5 English Language Proficiency
See section 1.1.7. Some units specify an additional language requirement for the Ph.D. degree. Students should
check unit supplemental regulations regarding this requirement.
5.1.6 Students with Disabilities
See Accommodation Policy for Students with Disabilities:
http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/students/281.html
5.2 Student Advisor, Co-advisor and Advisory Committee
5.2.1 Student Advisor
Every Ph.D. student must have an advisor, appointed by the Head of the unit. The advisor is responsible for
supervising the student’s graduate program. The advisor is the student’s first point of contact at The University of
Manitoba, and therefore should be familiar with the general policies and regulations of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies as well as the specific supplementary regulations of their academic unit. The advisor is directly responsible
for the supervision of the student's graduate program. In this capacity, the advisor assists the student in planning the
graduate program, and ensures that the student is aware of all graduate program requirements, degree regulations,
and general regulations of the academic unit, the Faculty of Graduate Studies, the university, and external funding
agencies. The academic advisor provides counsel for all aspects of the graduate program, and stays informed of the
student's scholarly activities and progress. The student’s advisor also acts as a channel of communication to the
student’s advisory committee, the unit, and the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
The advisor must:
 be a member of the Faculty of Graduate Studies;
 hold a Ph.D. or equivalent*;
 be active in research;
 have expertise in a discipline related to the student’s program;
 hold an appointment in the student's unit.
*Equivalency will be approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and determined on a case by case
basis and assessed by the potential advisor’s demonstrated research record and current research activities. Note that
M.D., D.M.D. and J.D. are undergraduate degrees and are not considered per se to be equivalent to a Ph.D.
Usually the student and the advisor choose to work together by mutual agreement. In units where the choice of thesis
topic advisor is postponed for some time after entry into the program, the Head of the unit or the selection committee
shall appoint a faculty member to advise the student as to the rules and regulations and on a program and course
requirements. This interim period must not exceed eighteen months after entry in to the program before a permanent
advisor is chosen.
A staff member at the University of Manitoba at the rank of Assistant Professor or above cannot have an advisor/coadvisor with an appointment in the same unit.
The advisor, co-advisor (if applicable) and student must discuss, and complete, the Faculty of Graduate Studies
Advisor Student Guidelines (ASG) prior to the commencement of any research and no later than the submission of
the first Progress Report for the student. If the parties cannot agree on any component(s) of the ASG, the matter
should be referred to the unit Graduate Chair, the Head of the unit, or the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Should, during the student’s program, the relationship between the student and advisor significantly deteriorate, the
matter should be referred sequentially to the unit Graduate Chair, the Head of the unit, then to the Dean of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.2.2 Co-advisor
In special circumstances, upon approval of the Head of the unit, an advisor and a maximum of one (1) co-advisor
may advise a student. The co-advisor must meet all of the same qualifications and expectations as the advisor.
The co-advisor must:

280

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18




be a member of the Faculty of Graduate Studies;
hold a Ph.D. or equivalent*;
be active in research;
have expertise in a discipline related to the student's program;.
 Hold an appointment in the student’s unit.
*Equivalency will be approved by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies, determined on a case by case basis
and assessed by the potential co-advisor’s demonstrated research record and current research activities. Note that
M.D., D.M.D. and J.D. are undergraduate degrees and are not considered per se to be equivalent to a Ph.D.
The co-advisor will usually be identified either:
A) at the beginning of a student’s program in situations where:
1. the student desires to draw equally upon the expertise of two individuals, or
2. the project is interdisciplinary in nature and requires the expertise of two advisors from their respective disciplines
or
B) mid-way through a student’s program due to:
1. the student's project developing in such a way as he/she requiring an additional advisor from a different
discipline; or
2. the unit introducing a new Faculty member, to the standards of the unit, whose expertise facilitates the
student's project.
When an advisor and co-advisor are assigned, together they shall fulfill the role of the advisor (that is, neither shall
fulfill any other advisory or examining committee membership requirements for that student). One advisor must be
identified as the primary advisor; however, both the advisor and co-advisor’s signatures are required on all
documents where the advisor’s signature is required.
A student who also holds an appointment at The University of Manitoba at the rank of Assistant Professor or above
cannot have an advisor or co-advisor with an appointment in the same unit. A staff member at the University of
Manitoba at the rank of Assistant Professor or above cannot have an advisor/co-advisor with an appointment in the
same unit.
In all instances the Faculty of Graduate Studies must be informed of, and approve, the co-assignment.
5.2.3 Advisory Committee
The Head of the unit is responsible for the establishment of an advisory committee for each Ph.D. student. Advisory
committees are normally selected by the advisor/co-advisor in consultation with the student and should consist of
individuals whose expertise is consistent with that necessary to provide additional advice and guidance to the student
during his/her program. The advisory committee must consist of a minimum of three members of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies, one of whom must hold a primary appointment from within the unit and one of whom must hold no
appointment within the unit. Advisory committees may, in addition, include one non-voting guest member who has
expertise in a related discipline but is not a member of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
It is expected that, under normal circumstances, Advisory Committee members will have a Ph.D. degree or
equivalent. Equivalency will be determined by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Graduate students may
not serve on graduate student advisory committees. A student who also holds an appointment at The University of
Manitoba at the rank of Assistant Professor or above cannot have an advisor or co-advisor with an appointment in the
same unit.A staff member at the University of Manitoba at the rank of Assistant Professor or above, cannot have an
advisory committee member with an appointment in the same unit. The composition of, and any changes to, the
advisory committee, including the advisor/co-advisor, must be approved by the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the
“Program of study & appointment of advisory committee” form
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). The advisor/co-advisor is the Chair of the advisory
committee. Advisory committee meetings which must be held at least annually, and are not intended to take the place
of meetings between the student and advisor/co-advisor, which should occur with much greater frequency than the
advisory committee meetings.
5.3 Program of Study

281

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
As soon as possible, but no later than 24 months after a student has commenced their program, the student’s
program of study should be registered with the Faculty of Graduate Studies on the “Program of study & appointment
of advisory committee” form (http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html). and should include:
 information about the minimum or expected time for completion of the degree;
 coursework to be taken;
 any foreign language requirement;
 the research area in which the thesis will be written.
The approval of the student’s advisor/co-advisor and the Head of the unit are sufficient for registration. The program
of study, including withdrawal from individual courses and any subsequent changes, must be approved by the
student’s advisor/co-advisor, the advisory committee, and the Head of the unit. Withdrawal from courses or changes
of course category without such approval may result in the student being required to withdraw from the Faculty of
Graduate Studies.
5.4 Program Requirements
All students must complete one of the following programs of study for the Ph.D. degree, unless otherwise specified in
the approved unit supplemental regulations:
 Where admission to the Ph.D. is directly from a Master’s degree, a minimum of 12 credit hours at the 7000
level or higher plus a thesis is required. Any further coursework beyond the minimum 12 credit hours at the
7000 level must be at the 3000 level or above. For those students who hold a Master’s degree, a maximum
of 24 credit hours of coursework is allowed toward the Ph.D. program.
 Where admission to the Ph.D. is directly from an Honours Bachelor degree or equivalent, a minimum of 24
credit hours plus a thesis is required. The coursework must include a minimum of 18 credit hours at the
7000 level or higher with the balance of the coursework at the 3000 level or higher. For those students who

Graduate Studies.
5.7 Academic Requirement for Graduation
A cumulative degree grade point average of 3.0 or greater is required in those courses that constitute the program of
study for graduation in the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.8 Candidacy Examination
The candidacy examination is an absolute requirement of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and, as such, cannot be
waived under any circumstances. However, the format and content of the candidacy exam will varyies from unit to
unit. The purposes of the candidacy exam in doctoral programs is to determine the student's competence in the
discipline with respect to understanding and absorbing a broad spectrum of material, and then researching,
identifying, analysing, synthesizing, and communicating ideas about that material in depth.
At the time specified by the advisory committee - --normally within the first year after the completion of the Ph.D.
program coursework but in no case later than one year prior to expected graduation -- the student must successfully
complete the formal candidacy examination.
The examination is conducted according to a procedure established by the unit and approved by the Academic Guide
Committee of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Please see the unit supplemental regulations for the format and
composition of the examination committee for the candidacy examination. The candidacy examination must be held
at The University of Manitoba.
This examination, which must be is independent from the thesis proposal, may be oral, written, or both and may
cover subjects relevant to the general area of the candidate's research. The structure of the exam se must be made
known to the students well in advance of the exam.
A pass decision of the examiners must be unanimous. Students must be provided with feedback on their
performance and access to the reasons for the pass/fail.
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies must be informed whether the candidate has passed or failed the
candidacy examination on the “Report on Ph.D. Candidacy Examination” form
(http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html).
Any student who fails the candidacy examination twice will be required to withdraw from the Faculty of Graduate
Studies.
On successful completion of this examination, the student will be considered a candidate for the Ph.D. degree.
5.9 Thesis Proposal
Some units have specific procedures in place for approval of thesis proposals and students are advised to refer to the
specific unit supplemental regulations. If units require thesis proposal approval, this exercise must beis independent
from the candidacy examination. Regardless, the proposed thesis research must be approved by the advisory
committee and, if necessary, by the Human Research Ethics Board or Animal Care Committee before the work has
begun on the thesis research or project.

284

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18

5.10 Thesis
An essential feature of Ph.D. study is the candidate’s demonstration of competence to complete a research project
and present the findings. The thesis must constitute a distinct contribution to knowledge in the major field of study,
and the research must be of sufficient merit to be, in the judgement of the examiners, acceptable for publication.
The thesis must be written according to a standard style acknowledged within the candidate’s particular field of study
and recommended by the unit, be lucid and well- written, and be reasonably free from errors of style and grammar
(including typographical errors).
The final version of the thesis must be submitted by the candidate to the Faculty of Graduate Studies following the
guidelines found at: http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/thesis/guidelines.html
5.11 Thesis Examination Procedures
The final examination for the Ph.D. degree proceeds in three stages (see Figure 5-1):
1. Examination of the candidate’s thesis by an internal examining committee.
2. Examination of the candidate’s thesis by an external examiner.
3. Oral examination of the candidate by all examiners on the subject of the thesis and any matters relating
thereto.
5.11.1 Formation of the Examining Committee I - University of Manitoba (Internal) Examiners
The candidate’s advisor (and, if appropriate, co-advisor) is considered to be a voting member of the examining
committee. The candidate’s advisor/co-advisor, in consultation with the Head of the unit, will recommend at least
three internal thesis examiners, including the advisor/co-advisor, to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies for
approval via the Thesis Submission Portal on JUMP. Normally All voting members of the advisory committee are
expected to serve on the is the examining committee; any exceptions must be approved in advance by the Dean of
the Faculty of Graduate Studies. One member must hold an primary appointment within the unit and one member
must hold no appointment within the unit. All internal examiners must be members of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies. It is expected that, under normal circumstances, Examining Committee members will have a Ph.D. degree
or equivalent. Equivalency will be determined by the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Under normal
circumstances these will be members of the candidate’s advisory committee, if not, approval must be obtained from
the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Note that in the case of an advisor and co-advisor, both together have
a single vote on the examining committee.
5.11.2 Formation of the Examining Committee II - External Examiner
The candidate’s advisor/co-advisor, in consultation with the advisory committee, will recommend the names of three
distinguished scholars from outside The University of Manitoba with particular experience in the field of the thesis
research and Ph.D. student advisory/examination experience to serve as the external examiner to the Dean of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies for approval via the Thesis Submission Portal on JUMP. The recommendations should,
if possible, include a brief CV of each of the prospective external examiners and a short statement detailing the
rationale behind the recommendations, the prospective external examiners’ qualifications, including a current list of
his/her scholarly publications and research activities and, importantly, their experience with graduate student
education. No contact should be made with any of the prospective external examiners. If any of the recommended
examiners does not meet the following criteria, specified below, a detailed explanation should be included with the
rationale for the recommendation.
The external examiner shouldmust:
 hold a Ph.D. or equivalent;
 hold the rank of Associate Professor, Full Professor, Senior Scholar or Emeritus Professor (or the equivalent
if outside North America) at a university, or have comparable expertise and standing if not a faculty member
at a university ;
 have an established reputation in the area of the thesis research and be able to judge whether the thesis
would be acceptable at an institution comparable to The University of Manitoba; and
 have a demonstrated record of supervising Ph.D. students to completion, and significant recent experience
with the supervision and/or examination of Ph.D. students.
The external examiner should must not:
 have acted as an external examiner for a student of the same Ph.D. supervisoradvisor within the previous
two years;
 have been associated with the candidate at any time or in any significant way in the past five years, present
or reasonably foreseeable future (advisor/co-advisor, colleague, teacher, co-author of published material,
family member etc.); or

285

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18


be associated with the candidate’s advisor/co-advisor in any of the following ways:
o former student;
o research advisor/co-advisor;
o research collaborator within the last five years;
o co-author of published material within the last five years.
o have had a significant academic disagreement with the candidate, the advisor/co-advisor or any
member of the advisory committee.

The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will choose the external examiner from the list provided by the
candidate’s advisor/co-advisor and will make the formal invitation to the external examiner. The Dean of the Faculty
of Graduate Studies shall ensure the anonymity of the external examiner until their report has been submitted it has
been determined that the student can proceed to oral defence.
5.11.3 Changes in the Examining Committee
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies must approve changes in the membership of the examining committee.
No changes shall be made in the examining committee after the thesis is submitted to the Faculty of Graduate
Studies. Should the thesis not be submitted for examination within 12 months after the appointment of the examining
committee, the committee appointment will lapse and the process shall revert to 5.11.1 above.
5.11.4 Distribution of the Thesis for Examination
Ph.D. students candidates must submit their thesis for distribution electronically through JUMP. Consult this link for
pertinent instructions: http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/media/Thesis_Distribution_Portal.pdf. It is the
responsibility of the Faculty of Graduate Studies to distribute the electronic version of the thesis to all examiners. The
Faculty of Graduate Studies shall attempt to ensure that the thesis is distributed to examiners as soon as possible
after the submission of all required documentation. The Faculty of Graduate Studies website
(umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/deadlines/index.html) should be consulted regarding dates by which theses
must be submitted.
Once the thesis has been submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies, neither the candidate nor the advisor/coadvisor shall have any communication with the examining committee regarding the thesis. However, should the need
arise, the external examiner may contact the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies to discuss any issues related to
the thesis.
5.11.5 Responsibilities of the Examiners
In general, the examiners are responsible for:
 ensuring that the thesis and the candidate meet recognized scholarly standards for a Ph.D.;
 appraising the underlying assumptions, methodology, findings, and scholarly significance of the findings of
the thesis;
 ensuring that the thesis is organized, presents data and uses accepted conventions for addressing the
scholarly literature in an acceptable manner;
 evaluating that the candidate has the ability to present their findings orally and demonstrate
their scholarship by responding to questions and defending the thesis.
Notes:
1.
2.

Any potential breach of academic integrity should be reported to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies for investigation by the Vice President (Research and International).
Submission of previously published, peer-reviewed material in the thesis does not preclude its critical
examination, either as a written document being reviewed by examiners or at the thesis defence.

5.11.6 Process
Internal Examiners
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will request the internal examiners to give, within three (3) weeks of the
distribution of the thesis, a detailed written report of the thesis and place it into one of the following categories:
1. The thesis represents a distinct contribution to the candidate’s field of research and is acceptable as it
stands. Minor revisions to content, structure, or writing style may be required. The thesis may proceed to
external distribution.
2. The thesis has merit and makes a contribution to the candidate’s field; however, there are research-related
concerns that have the potential to be addressed in the oral defence. The structure and writing style are
acceptable or require some only minor revisions. The thesis may proceed to external distribution.

286

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
3.

The thesis has some merit, but is not acceptable in its current state and requires major revisions to one or
more of its core components, such as research content, structure or writing style. The thesis should not
proceed to external distribution.
4. The thesis is unacceptable with respect to its core components, such as research content, structure, and
writing style. The thesis should not proceed to external distribution.
If none or one (the dissenting voice) of the internal examiners fails the thesis (i.e. places it in categories 3 or 4
above), the thesis receives an internal pass and shall proceed to external distribution. The candidate’s advisor (and, if
appropriate, co-advisor) may also wish to submit a report. Prior to external distribution, the candidate shall have the
opportunity to incorporate changes suggested by the examining committee but not necessarily those of the dissenting
voice. It is the joint responsibility of the advisor/co-advisor and student to provide all internal committee members with
a copy of the revised thesis along with a written and detailed summary of all significant revisions made to well in
advance of the oral defence.all internal committee members prior to the oral defence.
If two or more members of the internal examining committee fail the thesis (i.e. places the thesis in categories 3 or 4
above) then the thesis fails.
If the thesis fails, the unit Head shall convene a meeting of the internal examining committee and the candidate’s
advisor/co-advisor to decide how to bring the thesis to an acceptable scholarly standard for a second submission to
the internal examining committee. In normal circumstances, this will involve additional scholarly work which the unit
Head will describe, in writing, to the advisor/co-advisor, the candidate, and the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies.
If two or more members of the internal examining committeemore than one of the internal examining committee
members fail the resubmitted thesis, this constitutes a second failure. In the case of a second failure, the candidate
cannot proceed to external distribution, and the candidate is required to withdraw from the Faculty of Graduate
Studies.
The awarding of a passing grade by an individual internal examiner does not preclude them from awarding a failing
grade at a subsequent stage in the examination process. The performance of a student at the oral examination may
reveal problems of comprehension or explanation, and the examining committee may require revisions be made to
the written thesis to address these problems prior to granting its final approval.
External Examiner
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will request the external examiner to give, within three (3) weeks of the
distribution of the thesis, a detailed written report of the thesis and rate it either as a pass or a fail. The Dean of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies shall ensure the anonymity of the external examiner until their report has been
submittedreceived it has been determined that the student can proceed to oral defence.
 If the external examiner passes the thesis, the student can proceed to oral defence.
 If the external examiner fails the thesis, the unit Head shall convene a meeting of the internal examining
committee and the student’s advisor/co-advisor to decide how to bring the thesis to an acceptable scholarly
standard. In normal circumstances, this will involve additional scholarly work. which tThe unit Head will
provide a detailed written remediation plandescribe, in writing, to the advisor/co-advisor, the candidate. and
the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
 If the external examiner fails a resubmitted thesis, this constitutes a second failure. In the case of a second
failure, the candidate cannot proceed to oral defence, and the candidate is required to withdraw from the
Faculty of Graduate Studies.
The awarding of a passing grade by an external examiner does not preclude them from awarding a failing grade at a
subsequent stage in the examination process. The performance of a student at the oral examination may reveal
problems of comprehension or explanation, and the external examined may require revisions be made to the written
thesis to address these problems prior to granting final approval.
Reports
If advancement to the oral examination is approved, as outlined above, the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies
shall provide electronic copies of all reports to each of the advisor/co-advisor, examiners and Head of the unit.
5.12 The Oral Examination
5.12.1 Scheduling
Units cannot proceed with scheduling the oral defence prior to receiving the approved examiners report from the
Faculty of Graduate Studies. The examination must be held at The University of Manitoba. It is the responsibility of
the unit to ensure that all room booking arrangements are made and appropriate facilities meet minimum standards

287

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18
expected for a Ph.D. defence. In addition, the candidate must submit, in electronic format biographical information
and an abstract of the thesis to the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.12.2 Attendance
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies or designate shall act as Chair of the examination committee.
The attendance of the external examiner in person at the candidate’s oral examination is encouraged. If the external
examiner will not be present in person, his/her participation via video conferencing is expected. If the external
examiner cannot participate electronically, he/she will be asked to provide questions in advance. These questions will
be read to the candidate at the defence by the Chair.
All internal members of the examining committee are required to be present at the defence, unless exceptional
circumstances prevent this. Under such circumstances, and with the prior approval of the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies, one internal member may participate via video conferencing. Consequently, no more than one
internal member and the external examiner may participate via video conferencing.
Under no circumstances can the candidate participate by video conferencing.
Normally, the oral examination shall be open to all members of The University of Manitoba community and the
general public. In exceptional cases the final oral examination may be closed; for example, when the results of the
thesis research must be kept confidential for a period of time. In such cases, the examination committee and Head of
the unit shall request prior approval in writing from the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. If approved, the final
oral examination shall be closed to all but the examining committee and the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies
or designate.
Regardless of open or closed status, no recording devices will be permitted.
5.12.3 Format of the Examination
The first part of the oral examination shall consist of an oral presentation by the candidate. This is followed by
examination of the candidate by the examination committee. If time permits the Chair, at their discretion, may allow
questions from members of the audience.
5.12.4 Procedures for the Conduct of the Examination
The Chair should discuss the examination procedures with the examiners in camera prior to the beginning of the
formal examination.
The Chair will introduce the candidate and request him/her to give a concise (20 to 25 minute) oral presentation of the
thesis to include a summary of the problem addressed, the results obtained, and the conclusions drawn from the
study.
Following the presentation, the Chair will invite questions from each member of the examining committee, taking care
to ensure that each examiner has approximately equal time for questions. The total time for questions by the
examining committee must not exceed two (2) hours.
The Chair may exercise his/her discretion in allowing questions from the audience following completion of the formal
examination. Once assuming the role of Chair, he/she foregoes the right to comment on the merits of the thesis
whether or not he/she is an expert in the field.
5.12.5 Decision of the Committee
Following completion of the formal examination, the candidate and audience must leave the examination room. The
decision of the examining committee will be based both on the content of the thesis and on the candidate's ability to
defend it. The performance of the candidatea student at the oral examination may reveal problems of comprehension
or explanation, and the examining committee may require revisions be made to the written thesis to address these
problems prior to granting final approval.
The judgement of the examiners shall be reported by the Chair to the Faculty of Graduate Studies in the qualitative
terms “pass” or “fail” on the “Final Examination of the Ph.D. Thesis” form.
 Pass: the candidate has satisfactorily presented the thesis their rationale, methodology, findings, and
conclusions to the general satisfaction of the orally and answered, to the satisfaction of the examiningation
committee, the methodology, observations and conclusions presented in the thesis. Notwithstanding this,
stylistic, grammatical, and content revisions to the thesis may be required. Normally, Tthe advisor/coadvisor is charged with ensuring that any minor editorial or typographical revisions are satisfactorily
completed. Under some circumstances, the entire examining committee other members of the examining

committee may wish to ensure any required revisions are substantive changes are completed satisfactorily.
Regardless, Tthose examiners in agreement must indicate, by their signatures, concurrence with the
passing grade.
Fail: the candidate has failed to adequately orally present the thesis rationale, methodology, findings, and/or
conclusions, or to satisfactorily respond to questions posed related to, the thesis. Failure may also arise
because of This shall include significant defects in conception, methodology, or context. Those examiners
in agreement must indicate, by his/her signature, concurrence with the failing grade.

If either the external examiner or two or more internal examiners indicate a fail, the candidate fails the examination. In
this case, the Chair must submit of Aa copy of the report, including providing written detailed reasons for the decision,
will be made available to the candidate, all members of the examining committee, and by the Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies.
In the case of a first failure of the oral defence, the candidate will have the opportunity to discuss the report with the
internal examining committee. If the thesis is revised, then it is strongly recommended that the candidate circulate it
to the members of the internal examining committee and obtain their informal approval to proceed to a second
distribution before doing so. A new copy of the thesis If a revised thesis is required, it should be submitted directly to
the Faculty of Graduate Studies for distribution to the external examiner and examining committee within 3 months of
the failed oral examination, in preparation for a second and final oral examinationdefence. The candidate is already
deemed to have passed the thesis (Section 5.11.6); however, the examination during the oral defence shall be based
on the revised document.
In the case of either a second failure of the oral defence, or the combination of a failure of the written thesis and the
oral defence, the candidate will be required to withdraw from the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
5.13 Candidate Awards
The examination committee may recommend in writing to the Faculty of Graduate Studies that the thesis is of
sufficient merit to receive an award.
5.14 Graduation
The candidate will be recommended for the Ph.D. degree upon receipt by the Faculty of Graduate Studies of
favourable reports by the thesis examining committee, a corrected copy of the electronic version of the thesis
submitted to MSpace, final approval and release forms, and providing all other degree requirements have been
satisfied.
Patents –Refer to section 6 “Policy of Withholding Theses Pending Patent Applications” in this Guide.
Restriction of Theses for Publication – In exceptional cases, not covered by the regulation concerning patents,
where adequate cause can be shown to delay publication, the student and advisor/co-advisor may request in writing
that the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies restrict access for a period up to one year after the submission of
the digital version of a thesis to The University of Manitoba. The Dean shall determine for what period, if any, access
will be so restricted.

SECTION 6: Policy of Withholding Thesis Pending a Patent
Application Content or Manuscript Submission
SECTION 6: Policy of Withholding Thesis Pending Patent Applications Content or Manuscript Submission
In 1970, The University of Manitoba Board of Governors and Senate approved a policy on accepting research grants
from outside agencies. This policy defined the right of agencies to defer release of information and thus ensure
freedom of publications for research findings of University personnel. Occasionally, the University may also wish to
restrict the release of a thesis pending patent application. For additional details, see The University of Manitoba
governing document: http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/community/235.html
This situation may arise in the two circumstances defined below, both of which are governed by the same set of
regulations:.
1. Where a research project is known to contain patentable items as defined in the research contract, then it is
the responsibility of the advisor/co-advisor to give written information of the restrictions on publication to the
student prior to the start of the thesis research. If the student agrees to carry out the research, then the
regulation given below will apply.
2. Where a patentable item is found during the course of research, then the advisor/co-advisor and the student
may make application for patent rights through the University Patent Committee, and the following regulation
will apply concerning the release of the thesis.
Regulations Concerning Release of a Thesis During Application and Negotiation For Patents
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will receive the approved thesis. On written joint request of the
advisor/co-advisor and the student, the Dean will retain the thesis for a period not to exceedup to one year.
Regulations Concerning Release of Thesis Pending Manuscript Submission
The Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies will receive the approved thesis. On written joint request of the advisor
and the student, the Dean will keep retain the thesis for a period up to one year.
In exceptional cases, not covered by the regulation concerning patents, where adequate causes can be shown to
delay publication, the student and advisor/co-advisor may request in writing that the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
studies restrict access for a period up to one year after submission of the digital version of a thesis or practicum to
The University of Manitoba. The Dean shall determine for what period, if any, access will be so restricted.

291

SECTION 7: Extension of Time to Complete Program of Study
SECTION 7: Extension of Time to Complete Program of Study Content
All requests for extensions will normally be dealt with administratively and reported, in summary form, to the
Executive Committee of Graduate Studies for information. The student must complete the "Time Extension Request
for Extension" Fform” http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html and submit it to his/her major
unit for recommendation to the Faculty of Graduate Studies at least three, but no more than four, months prior to
expiration of the respective maximum time limit. Requests for an extension are reviewed by the Faculty of Graduate
Studies on a case by case basis.
Requests for extension must be accompanied by a realistic detailed timeline that has been agreed upon to by the
student and advisor/co-advisor and endorsed by the unit Head. The extension time requested must closely reflect the
time required to complete the program.
The normal time granted requested for extensions is four to eight months. More than one extension period may be
grantedconsidered. However the total approved for all extensions will not normally exceed one year. The Dean may
request a report from the student and/or the advisor/co-advisor during the extension that the timeline is being fulfilled,
prior to approving the final period of the extension.

SECTION 8: Leaves of Absence
8.1 Regular Leave
A regular leave is intended to allow students to meet responsibilities/plans related to family, travel or employment and
circumstances not covered by the parental or exceptional leaves. At the student’s request, the Head of the unit may
recommend to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies that a student be granted a leave of absence for a period
of time not to exceed one year. While on a regular leave of absence, a student is not expected to be actively engaged
in their program of study conduct study and/or thesis research work. A student on a regular leave of absence is
required to maintain continuous registration. A student on a regular leave of absence will not be assessed program
fees, if any are owing, during the period of the leave; however, the appropriate continuing fee will be assessed.* Any
program fees deferred as a result of a regular leave will be assessed when the student returns from leave. A regular
leave of absence status does not extend time limits as outlined in Faculty of Graduate Studies regulations.
Note: At the time of approval of an application for leave, the procedures for the return of the student to the unit at the
completion of the leave must be stipulated.
*Program Fees: The continuing fee in effect at the time of the granting of the leave will be levied. However, if the
student returns from leave in January, the normal tuition fee will be levied less the continuing fee is already paid.
8.2 Exceptional Leave
In exceptional circumstances for medical or compassionate reasons (e.g. the need to care for an ailing family
member), at the request of the student, the Head of the unit may recommend to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies that a student be granted an exceptional leave of absence for a period of time not to exceed one year.
Supplemental documentation should support the requested dates of the leave. Exceptional leaves must correspond
with the start and end of (an) academic term(s). While on an exceptional leave of absence, a student is not permitted
to be engaged in their program of study maintain study and/or thesis research work, and would not be required to
maintain continuous registration or, nor pay tuition fees. In addition, the leave period would not be included in the time
period allowed for the completion of the degree. This leave is not intended to cover circumstances related to travel,
employment, or financial concerns.
Note: At the time of approval of an application for leave, the procedures for the return of the student to the unit at the
completion of the leave must be stipulated.
8.2.1 Fees
Students are not expected to pay fees for the term in which they have been granted an exceptional leave. Upon
return from the exceptional leave, students will be assessed fees as determined by the Registrar’s Office.
8.3 Parental Leave

child immediately following a birth or adoption of a child is eligible for parental leave. The request for a parental leave
should be made through the unit, to the Faculty of Graduate Studies for a period of time not to exceed one year.
Parental leaves must correspond with the start and end of (an) academic term(s). While on leave of absence for
parental reasons, a student is not permitted to be engaged in their program of study maintain study and/or thesis
research work. The leave period is not included in the time period allowed for completion of the degree.
Note: At the time of approval of an application for leave, the procedures for the return of the student to the unit at the
completion of the leave must be stipulated.
8.3.1 Fees
Students are not expected to pay fees for the term in which they have been granted a parental leave. Upon return
from the parental leave students will be assessed fees as determined by the Registrar’s Office.

SECTION 9: Appeals – Procedures And Guidelines
9.1 General
Students who disagree with a decision have access to appeal routes as laid out by various Faculty of Graduate
Studies and University of Manitoba appeal procedures. Student appeals may be limited by the scope of the inquiry
available at each level and category of appeal, as well as by the time limitations for submission of appeals.
A further limitation is that the Faculty of Graduate Studies rules and regulations, established to uphold the academic
rigour of The University of Manitoba, are generally not subject to appeal unless an appeal route is otherwise
stipulated. In situations where no appeal route is available, a student may make a written request to the Dean of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Students are referred to the appeals section of The University of Manitoba Governing Documents
(http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/index.html) for further details.
For students registered in Joint Master's Programs (University of Manitoba and University of Winnipeg) there is a
different process for handling appeals and academic dishonesty cases than for University of Manitoba students in
regular programs (not Joint Programs). This process is outlined in the Joint Master's Program Governing Documents
available at http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/media/JMP_Regulations.pdf.

standing in, awards from, or disciplinary action by a unit or the Faculty of Graduate Studies;
 “Appeal Panel” – a panel convened from the members of the Faculty of Graduate Studies Appeals
Committee by the Executive Committee of the Faculty of Graduate Studies empowered to deal with appeals
stemming from decisions of units or the Faculty of Graduate Studies, or individuals designated to make such
decisions;
 “Unit” – the unit council, or appeal body, whose decision is being appealed. This is understood to include
decisions taken by individuals or committees acting in the name of the unit and also to the supplementary
regulations pertinent to a unit’s operation which have been approved by the Faculty of Graduate Studies;
 “Respondent” – a representative of the unit or the Faculty of Graduate Studies designated by the unit
Head/Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies to represent the unit or Faculty of Graduate Studies.
9.3 Types of Appeal
There are several areas of appeal which are open to appellants:
 admission;
 academic;
 discipline;
 administration (e.g. Fee appeals).
In all cases, appeals should be directed to the Dean of the faculty of Graduate Studies. A desisiondecision of the
Faculty of Graduate Studies Appeal Panel is appealable only to the Senate Committee on Appeals or the University
Discipline Committee, as appropriate. In all cases an appellant shall have the option of being registered in, and
undertaking the responsibilities of, his/her program, until such time as he/she has exhausted the university appeal
process or the appellant decides not to appeal further, whichever comes first.

DRAFT ACADEMIC GUIDE 2017-18

In some cases, copyright holders prefer to use their own permission forms and/or will provide their permission
electronically. Both of these are acceptable by the Faculty of Graduate Studies.
Note that obtaining permission may take a considerable amount of time and this must be taken into consideration
when meeting a thesis/practicum submission deadline. A reference to written permission having been obtained must
be included under the image or text. The reference should also include the date the permission was granted, and the
name/title of the copyright holder(s). The original form(s) signed by the copyright holders should be retained by the
student with a copy provided to the Faculty of Graduate Studies at the completion of the thesis/practicum.
The thesis/practicum cannot be accepted by the Faculty of Graduate Studies if permission has not been obtained. It
is important that the student and their advisor ensure that the permission has been granted. In some cases, the
copyright holder cannot be located or the cost is prohibitive to using the text or image. In these situations, the text or
image may have to be omitted from the thesis/practicum.
Subsequently, information on where the reader can locate the image or text should be included, such as the URL,
title of book/journal, volume and issue number, page number, publisher, and date of publication. A description of the
purpose or significance of the text or image should be provided.

2.0 Manuscript/Grouped Manuscript Style
A thesis/practicum may comprise a paper, or collection of papers, which are, or are about to be, published. The
number of papers that comprise this style of thesis/practicume will be determined between the student and the
advisory committee. The formatting of the thesis/practicum must be consistent throughout the thesis/practicum and
the thesis/practicum cannot merely consist of several papers or articles bound within the one document.
Publication, or acceptance for publication, of research results prior to the presentation of the thesis/practicum does
not supersede the evaluation of the work by the examination committee (i.e. does not guarantee that the
thesis/practicum will be found acceptable). Examiners may specify revisions regardless of the publication status.
The thesis/practicum must follow the same prefatory information (1.1), spelling, formatting margin requirements, page
numbering (1.2b-d), footnotes and appendices (1.3), figures, illustrations photographs and drawings (1.4) and any
additional material (1.5) as those outlined above.
There must be an introductory chapter to the entire thesis/practicum which includes its own bibliography. The
collection of papers or articles must contribute toward the overall theme that represents the thesis/practicum work
and must be smoothly integrated into the flow of the thesis/practicum to produce a unified document. This may
require changes or additions to, and re-writing of, any work which has been previously published.
The thesis/practicum must contain connecting text between the different chapters providing logical links to allow the
integration of the information. These connecting sections are mandatory. Not including these sections may
compromise the ability of the examiners to evaluate the thesis/practicum and accordingly there may be subsequent
potential consequences.
The thesis/practicum must contain a concluding chapter that includes a discussion on how the thesis/practicum, with
its findings, provides a distinct contribution to knowledge in the research area.
In the case of multi-authored papers, the nature and extent of the student/candidate’s contribution, and those of the
other authors, must be explicitly specified in a section entitled "Contributions of Authors" in the “Preface” of the
thesis/practicum. The advisor/co-advisor, by signing the thesis/practicum submission form, attests to the accuracy of
these statements and will be asked to reaffirm at the oral defence in the case of a doctoral thesis/practicum.

Report of the Senate Committee on Academic Review RE: Proposal for an Indigenous
Institute of Health and Healing
Preamble:
1.

The policy Academic Centres and Institutes is available on the web at:

The procedures Academic Centres and Institutes are available at:
http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/academic/935.html.

3.

The Senate Committee on Academic Review (SCAR) met on February 17, 2017, to
consider a proposal from the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences to establish an
Indigenous Institute for Health and Healing.

Observations:
1.

At its meeting on February 17, 2017, the Committee received the Report of the ad hoc
Committee of SCAR (attached), which had been struck to review the proposal in detail.
The ad hoc Committee had recommended that SCAR endorse the proposal to establish
the Institute, for a period of five years, with continuation subject to a review process.

2.

The Committee was concerned that the proposal should identify members of the Institute
beyond the initial membership (which would comprise individuals holding Leadership
positions in the Institute) and a process to appoint those additional members. The
committee was informed that a process for appointing members would be developed in
consultation with Indigenous communities. The appropriate time for these discussions to
occur would be following formal approval of the Institute by the University, to ensure that
the communities were engaged in a meaningful way in the development of the process.
The proponents have revised section 5.0 of the proposal to identify the need for this step
in the process of developing procedures for appointing members to the Institute.

3.

The Committee requested that, at the end of the first twelve months following the
implementation of the Institute, the Head of the Institute provide clear procedures for
appointing members to the Institute that would outline how members of the broader
University community could participate as members or otherwise interact with the
Institute. The proponents of the proposal have revised section 5 of the proposal, to
reflect that this request would be addressed within six to twelve months.

4.

The Committee was also concerned that the proposal should be clear that the
Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing would be a University Institute that would
facilitate collaborations across the institution. In response to this, the proponents have
revised section 5.0 of the proposal to indicate that, because Colleges within the Rady
Faculty of Health Sciences alone cannot address the health and healing continuum,
which includes collaboration and integration of all aspects of the physical, spiritual,

303

intellectual, and emotional aspects of an individual, members of the broader University
community would be invited and encouraged to become members of the Institute.

Recommendation:
The Senate Committee on Academic Review recommends:
THAT Senate recommend that the Board of Governors approve a proposal to establish
the Indigenous Institute for Health and Healing for a period of five years, with
continuation subject to a review process and with the proviso that, at the end of the first
twelve months, the Head of the Institute would forward clear procedures for appointing
members to the Institute, for review by the Senate Committee on Academic Review and
Senate.

Respectfully submitted,
Dr. David Collins, Chair
Senate Committee on Academic Review

Comments of the Senate Executive Committee:
The Senate Executive Committee endorses the
report to Senate.

Report of the ad hoc Committee of the Senate Committee on Academic Review RE:
Proposal for the Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing
Preamble:

The procedures Academic Centres and Institutes are available at:
http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/academic/935.html.

3.

The ad hoc Committee met on May 10, June 20, and October 11, 2016 to consider a
proposal from the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences (hereafter “the Faculty”) to establish
the Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing (hereafter “the Institute”).

4.

Members of the ad hoc Committee were: Acting Dean T. Mondor (Chair; Faculty of
Graduate Studies), Ms. P. Bachewich (student, Faculty of Health Sciences), Dean D.
Brown (Faculty of Kinesiology and Recreation Management), Professor D. Ruth (Faculty
of Engineering), and Professor D. Turcotte (College of Pharmacy).

Observations:
1.

The proposed Institute would be formed through the amalgamation of three longstanding entities in the Department of Community Health Sciences, Max Rady College of
Medicine: the J.A. Hildes Northern Medical Unit (NMU), the Manitoba First Nations
Centre for Aboriginal Health Research (MFN CAHR), and the Centre for Aboriginal
Health Education (CAHE). The three units are currently brought together under the
Section of First Nations, Métis and Inuit Health. 1 They support the Department and the
College by providing expertise in Indigenous health, including in the areas of health
service delivery, research, and education and training.

2.

Establishment of the Institute at the Faculty level would create new opportunities for
members of the Institute to also share their expertise and provide support to other
Colleges in the Faculty. It would also benefit the Faculty by creating a single point of
access for Indigenous health expertise and advancing Indigenous perspectives in health
education, research, and community outreach and service.

3.

The primary purpose of the Institute would be, “… to provide service that meets the
health needs of a diverse Indigenous community and culture in Manitoba and Nunavut
and to support the University in Indigenous Achievement and Success.”

4.

The mission of the Institute would be, “to honour relationships, inspire minds, and
contribute to the health and wellness for First Nations, Métis, and Inuit children,
families and communities.” The objectives of the Institute would be to:

1

The Section is to be dissolved pending the approval and implementation of the Institute.

305

promote the development of nationally and internationally recognized programs of
clinical service, education and training, and research excellence at the University in four
areas: biomedical, clinical, health services, and social, cultural, environmental and
population health;
advise the University, the Faculty and its Colleges, on issues of relevance to First
Nations, Métis, and Inuit communities and priorities in health services delivery,
education and training, and research;
provide support for Indigenous Achievement through leadership in the Faculty;
take a leadership role in developing, supporting, and assisting in the
development of comprehensive, high-quality models of service delivery in First
Nations, Métis, and Inuit communities;
provide mentorship opportunities to support First Nations, Métis, and Inuit
students, community and university-based researchers and service providers in
achieving their goals in health professional studies, clinical service, academic
service, and research;
promote and support Indigenous health research that addresses the needs of
First Nations, Métis, and Inuit communities;
support and advise First Nations, Métis, and Inuit governments and organizations
on health policy issues based on the best available knowledge, experience, and
research evidence;
facilitate communication and knowledge sharing concerning Indigenous health
and Indigenous health education development nationally and internationally;
facilitate skill development in the Faculty in engaging with First Nations, Métis,
and Inuit communities, bi-directional knowledge exchange, and provision of highquality, culturally safe health professional education and clinical service delivery.

5.

The mission and objectives of the Institute align to the University’s five strategic
priorities, established in the document Taking Our Place: University of Manitoba
Strategic Plan 2015-2020.

6.

The Institute would have responsibility for a broad range of activities in the areas of (i)
collaborative partnership building, (ii) excellence in teaching, (iii) advancing scientific
achievement through research and innovation, (iv) addressing the needs of Indigenous
populations from a social accountability perspective respecting Treaty, constitutional and
international rights, and (v) development of a safe and equitable workplace and learning
environment. Various activities within each of these areas are detailed in section 2.2.2 of
the proposal. Some academic activities are highlighted below:
•

•
•
•
•

Establishing collaborative partnerships with academic units and First Nations,
Métis, and Inuit communities, to develop enhanced programming, partnershipbased research and service delivery models, and informing education of future
health professions.
Support and guide the development and implementation of Indigenous health
content into curricula.
Focus training of future generations in Inter-Professional Education and Practice
in partnership with Indigenous communities.
Within the Institute, facilitate enhanced Indigenous student mentorship in
teaching.
Improve Indigenous patient engagement in health care delivery.

306

•
•
•
•
•
7.

Enhance cultural safety and communication skills, and increase cultural safety
and anti-racism education and health research.
Enhance opportunities for community outreach and service, working with
communities to enhance pipeline program outcomes.
Support University efforts in training future generations of health care
professionals.
Address equity issues for Indigenous learners and patients.
Lead the collaborative development of specific Indigenous health-related goals in
the Faculty.

The Head of the Institute, who would normally be the Vice-Dean (Indigenous), would
report to, and be appointed by, the Dean and Vice-Provost of the Rady Faculty of Health
Sciences. Financial responsibility for the Institute would rest with the Vice-Dean
(Indigenous).
The Executive Lead (Academics) would report to the Head and would be responsible for
academic functions, liaising with academic programs and Colleges on matters related to
students, curriculum, research platform development with Indigenous communities. The
Executive Lead (Health Services) would report to the Head and would be responsible for
operational functions, including high level negotiations with governments and Indigenous
communities regarding service delivery models.
There will be College Leads Advisory Council.

8.

The initial membership of the Institute would include those individuals who would hold
Leadership positions within the Institute, as described in section 3.1.2 of the proposal.
Additional members might include representatives from the three constituent units, the
NMU, MFN CAHR, and CAHE, and faculty, from Colleges in the Faculty of Health
Sciences and from other faculties at the University, who have partnerships or research
collaborations with members of the Institute. A process for applying for membership is to
be established, for approval by the Dean’s Council, Faculty of Health Sciences.

9.

Privileges of membership would include access to, and engagement with, colleagues
with expertise in Indigenous health and opportunities for academic career development
through engagement in Indigenous Health education, research, community engagement
and/or health service delivery in Indigenous communities.

10.

The Institute will ultimately be housed in a new building proposed for construction at the
Bannatyne Campus. At present, the NMU and CAHE are located in the Basic Sciences
Medical Building, and the MFN CAHR is situated in the Buhler Research Centre. Offices
of several faculty and staff who would hold Leadership positions in the Institute are
located in the Pathology Building.

11.

The Institute will be supported by funds totalling approximately $23.3 million (in
2017/2018) from the following sources: (i) long-term federal, provincial, and territorial
government grants (approximately $22 million) to support the activities of the NMU, (ii)
baseline funding through the Department of Community Health Sciences ($200,000), to
cover operating costs, (iii) external research grants awarded to members of Research
Network within the MFN CAHR, and (iv) allocations from provincial grants to the Faculty
and the College of Medicine ($660,674, in 2017/2018).

12.

The revenue would cover operational expenses and the cost of salaries for
administrative staff in the Institute and its constituent units (i.e. the NMU, CAHE), as
described in section 7.1 of the proposal. The Institute would have responsibility for

307

administration of central operational revenues and expenses, and for salaries of the
Elders in Residence, the Executive Lead (Academics), the Director (Education and
Student Support), the Director (Indigenous Health Integrations), the Operations
Manager, and Student Affairs.
The NMU and the MFN CAHR would retain responsibility for their respective budgets,
given their sources of revenue. The NMU would be responsible for salaries for the
following administrative staff: Executive Lead (Health Services), the Senior Lead,
Physicians, and the Director (Nursing Programs). Salaries for the Vice-Dean
(Indigenous) and Head and for the Director, Research, would continue to be funded with
baseline funding by the Faculty and the Department of Community Health Sciences,
respectively.
13.

The proposal was endorsed by the Faculty Executive Council of the Faculty of Health
Sciences, at its meeting on January 14, 2016.

14.

The proposal incorporates feedback offered by the ad hoc Committee of SCAR,
including, at the October 16th meeting, requests to: (i) clarify the purpose and objectives
of the Institute, particularly with respect to what would be accomplished by the
amalgamation of the NMU, the MFN CAHR, and CAHE; (ii) clarify the structure of the
academic unit, including the relationship of the constituent units to the Institute, in terms
of administration and governance; (iii) distinguish between administrative positions in the
Institute and members; and (iv) explain how the various sources of revenue would be
amalgamated or administered under the Institute, including whether the constituent units
or the Institute would have responsibility for salaries for administrative staff.

Recommendation
The ad hoc Committee of the Senate Committee on Academic Review recommends:
THAT the Senate Committee on Academic Review endorse a proposal to establish
the Indigenous Institute for Health and Healing, for a period of five years, with
continuation subject to a review process.

Subject:

Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing

Attached please find a proposal to establish an Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing. This proposal
has been endorsed by the Faculty of Health Sciences Executive Council and has the strong support of the
Dean and Vice-Provost Faculty of Health Sciences, as indicated in the attached letter from Dr. Brian
Postl.
As indicated in the proposal, the Institute will serve as a mechanism to strengthen, coordinate and
facilitate a broad range of educational activities in Indigenous Health. The proposal brings together
three former units that have expertise in research, education and training, and health service delivery in
the realm of Indigenous Health. The three units/centers include the J. A. Hi/des Northern Medical Unit
(NMU}, the Manitoba First Nations Centre for Aboriginal Health Research (MFN CAHR) and the Centre
for Aboriginal Health Education (CAHE). As the proposal states, "The proposed creation of the
Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing at the level of the Faculty of Health Sciences will provide
opportunities to support the Colleges of Nursing, Dentistry, Pharmacy and Rehabilitation Sciences as
well as the College of Medicine. This will be of particular relevance and benefit in many activities but
currently:
• when developing Inter-Professional Education opportunities through distributed medical education
sites with a specific focus on Indigenous Health;
• with the development of partnership based research projects; and
• with the focus on Indigenous Health as a longitudinal course throughout the four years of medical
school and more emphasis on Indigenous Health in all health professional curricula."
The proposed Institute will facilitate the University's leadership role in future developments with
respect to education in Indigenous Health and is in keeping with the strategic plan and our strong focus
on Indigenous achievement.
According to University policy, academic centres/institutes are expected to:
(1) have clearly identified goals and objectives;
(2) have some degree of permanence, transcending collaboration on a particular, limited
project/program;

l l Pagc

309

{3) bring together educators from different disciplines and/or areas of specialization within a
particular discipline;
(4) attract visiting professors and other educations; and
(5) cooperate with educators at other universities and/or institutions.
The proposed Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing satisfies all of the above requirements.
I am in full support of the proposal from the Faculty of Health Sciences and request that you present it
to the Senate Committee on Academic Review for consideration and recommendation to Senate and, in
turn, the Board of Governors.
If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you.

1.0 Background
We are proposing the creation of an Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing (IIHH) that will reside within the
Rady Faculty of Health Sciences (RFHS) at the University of Manitoba Bannatyne campus. With the amalgamation
of three former units that have functioned as three silos operating independently, we are restructuring to form an
entity that is a single door entry to expertise in Indigenous Health and Healing with renewed purpose and a
mandate to support all five Colleges within the RFHS.
The three units have expertise in research, education and training, and health service delivery in the realm of
Indigenous Health. The units currently hold no formally recognized status as units or centers within the Faculty or
University. These units are to undergo restructuring into a single entity, the IIHH, with the governing and
operational oversight by the IIHH Institute Senior Management team that will include operational directors for
each stream. The three current units include:
J.A. Hildes Northern Medical Unit (NMU): The J. A. Hildes Northern Medical Unit (NMU) has been a unit
of the Max Rady College of Medicine in the Department of Community Health Sciences for more than 45
years. Under the leadership of Dr. J. A. Hildes, the University of Manitoba, in the Max Rady College of
Medicine, expanded the service mandate of the university to support the delivery of direct physician
services in underserved communities. The program initially began in Churchill, Manitoba and provided
local medical services in addition to the outreach medical services to remote communities in the Kivalliq
Region of the North West Territories. At the request of government, the NMU has since expanded to
providing service in multiple First Nation and some Metis communities in Manitoba. Funding supports are
through Federal and Provincial Grants that are renewed annually for the last 47 years, this funding will
continue and will be managed by the IIHH Operations.
Manitoba First Nations Centre for Aboriginal Health Research (MFN CAHR): In 2001, the University of
Manitoba, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, and the Foundations for Health provided funding support to
create the Centre for Aboriginal Health Research (CAHR). It replaced a research group, created in 1986
known as the Northern Health Research Unit. CAHR, now known as the Manitoba First Nations Centre for
Aboriginal Health Research (MFN CAHR) in 2006, is recognized nationally and internationally. Multiple
researchers have formed a Research Network in support of Indigenous Health, and these researchers rely
on the Administrative support in the unit to manage their grants. Funding is dependent on the level of
successful grants acquired by the Research Network membership and is currently secure.
The Centre for Aboriginal Health Education (CAHE): In 2005, following lobbying by Indigenous Medical
students and the ACCESS Programs of the Division of Extended Education; the Office of the Dean of
Medicine established the Center for Aboriginal Health Education (CAHE). The Centre provides a
welcoming and safe place for Indigenous students to seek access to much needed resources and
supports. The unit has baseline funding through the former Faculty of Medicine, Department of
Community Health Sciences and this funding is transferred to the IIHH for administrative oversight.
The units were situated ‘informally’ in the former Faculty of Medicine, now Max Rady College of Medicine,
Department of Community Health Sciences (CHS) and have provided significant benefits to the Max Rady College
of Medicine and CHS in the development of competency in community engagement and cultural safety with
Indigenous (First Nations, Metis and Inuit) communities.
They have provided support and expertise for the purposes of strengthening research relationships, supporting the
recruitment and retention of Indigenous learners, contributing to education and teaching, and delivering health
services in First Nations, Metis and Inuit communities. The ability to develop teaching and clinical training
opportunities as well as the development of capacity in community-based and participatory research projects have
been enhanced through the health service delivery mandate of the Max Rady College of Medicine, and has been
supported through our relationships with the communities and government organizations.
Prior to the formation of the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, the three units came together as a Section of First
Nations, Metis and Inuit Health within the Department of Community Health Sciences (CHS) in the former

314

Faculty of Medicine. The establishment of the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, and the Office of the Vice Dean,
Indigenous provided an opportunity to further develop the community and academic partnership relationships
through the creation of an Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing.
With the amalgamation of the three units into one structure as the IIHH within the RFHS, the current Section of
First Nations, Metis and Inuit Health is dissolved as an entity within the Department of Community Health
Sciences.

Opportunities:
The proposed creation of the Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing (IIHH) at the level of the Rady Faculty of
Health Sciences will provide a single doorway to expertise and knowledge in Indigenous Health and Healing for the
RFHS and the entire University of Manitoba. Specifically, it will provide opportunities to support the Colleges of
Nursing, Dentistry, Pharmacy and Rehabilitation Sciences as well as the Max Rady College of Medicine in this field.
This will be of particular relevance and benefit in many activities but currently:
•
•
•
•

when developing Inter-Professional Education opportunities through distributed medical education sites
with a specific focus on Indigenous Health;
with the development of capacity in partnership based research projects; and
with the focus on Indigenous Health as a longitudinal course throughout the four years of medical school
and more emphasis on Indigenous Health in all health professional curricula
potential partnerships within the university for interdisciplinary policy electives – Indigenous Health and
the Law, Indigenous Health and Education, etc.

Creating the Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing (IIHH) will enhance the ability of the University to support
the development of service partnerships furthering opportunities for independence, autonomy and authority in
the First Nations, Metis and Inuit communities. Inter-professional education opportunities in Indigenous Health
will be enhanced, and opportunities for Inter-disciplinary policy electives will be explored.
The Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing will foster authentic engagement and relationship building in the
development of research partnerships and platforms; and it will actively engage in the utilization of Indigenous
knowledge for evidence and best practice development in curriculum, clinical skills, research skills and knowledge
sharing.

2.0 Contents of Proposal
2.1 Name of the Academic Centre / Institute
The formal name of record of the proposed Institute will be the Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing.
The Ojibway name brought forward by Ojibwe Elders following ceremony is ‘Ongomiizwin’ – translated as
‘Clearing a Path for Generations to Come’, consistent with the work of the current unit structures and with the
vision and mission of the proposed Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing.
It is the intent to enter into ceremony with Elders for the name to be recognized in Cree, Dakota, Dene, Oji-Cree,
Michif, French and Inuktitut while remaining within the University brand.

315

2.2 Description of, and Justification for, the Creation of an Institute of
Indigenous Health and Healing (IIHH) in the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences
(RFHS)
We are proposing the establishment of an Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing (IIHH) within the newly
formed Rady Faculty of Health Sciences (RFHS).
The proposed Academic Institute will ensure:
•
•

•

the advancement of Indigenous perspectives and scholarly work at the University of Manitoba
the development of productive partnerships resulting in health care models, excellence in student
support and Indigenous health education, and community based health research with First Nations,
Metis, Inuit and Indigenous communities1
support for the continued development of health care, health research, and education models that
are reflective of Indigenous values and perspectives through our commitment to knowledge
translation in the Indigenous community and in the academic community

The establishment of an Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing (IIHH) will meet all of the requirements of an
academic institute through our efforts to strengthen, coordinate and facilitate educational, research and clinical
training, and service model delivery in Indigenous Health. We believe that we meet the criteria for the
establishment of an academic institute within the University of Manitoba. As an Institute, we follow the policies
and procedures of the University. We have received the support of the Dean of the Rady Faculty of Health
Sciences, and the Deans of the Colleges of the RFHS for the proposed creation of the IIHH.
Our relationships with provincial, national and international colleagues are well established, and collaborative
projects and activities support our focus on Indigenous Health. Our international efforts and current international
project and mentorship grants have identified opportunities for knowledge sharing and information sharing that
will be of benefit to the University at large in the field of Indigenous Health.
We are financially secure, with a majority of our funding from external sources to conduct our activities. We have
an established Advisory Committee, established to guide the work of the former Section of First Nations, Metis and
Inuit Health, and are proposing that this Advisory fulfill this role with the addition of new members from other
educational sectors to further support our work on cultural safety in the academic sector. Finally, the Objectives
of the IIHH and the Relationship to the U of M Strategic Plan clearly highlight the process by which we will support
the goals of the University in their realm.
Currently three existing units function as three silos operating independently. The re-structuring of these three
existing units will result in the transfer of the existing staff, and the existing resources of the three units under the
governance oversight and administrative direction of the IIHH. The Institute governance model providing
administrative and governance oversight for this centralized unit will include the directors responsible for
operations for the three streams of activity (see Figure 1).
In addition to the RFHS, the IIHH will be a resource at the university level in sharing access to expertise in
Indigenous issues. This IIHH, as a central strong entity administered within the Faculty, will support the RFHS
Colleges in the development of productive partnerships resulting in health care models, excellence in student
support and Indigenous health education, and community based health research with First Nations, Metis, Inuit
and Indigenous communities1. Indigenizing the academic space through the establishment of culturally safe spaces
inside the bricks and mortar of academia is enhanced by the development of a Traditional Medical Garden on
campus and support of all activities by our Elders.
Our community engagement relationships, student mentorship programs, and international Indigenous education
and research linkages will facilitate the establishment of a unique Institute with a governance and administrative
model that focuses on Faculty Level activity and will support the Colleges, and some high level support to the
entire University of Manitoba as well as our Indigenous communities.

316

While the Institute will be physically located at the Bannatyne Campus in the RFHS, we will continue to participate
in activities and opportunities in Indigenous Health that cross many disciplines, departments and faculties at the
University of Manitoba.

2.2.1 Vision, Mission, Mandate, Objectives/Principles and Relationship to the U of M
Strategic Plan
The vision, mission and mandate for the proposed Institute are focused on the activities and strategies that can
support the Faculty (RFHS) and the University in advocating for those aspects of Indigenous self-determination and
community engagement that will enhance collaboration and support the University goal for Indigenous
achievement and success.
Vision: A world where First Nations, Metis and Inuit communities hold the power to create opportunity for
themselves and others
Mission: To honor relationships, inspire minds, and contribute to the health and well-being of First Nations, Metis
and Inuit children, families and communities.
Mandate: To provide leadership and advance excellence: in research, education and health systems innovation to
achieve the full potential of health and wellness for First Nations, Metis and Inuit Peoples.

We do this with continual guidance from our communities, knowledge keepers, elders and our ancestors;
and in alignment with the university’s strategic plan and its goal of Indigenous achievement and the
Rady Faculty of Health Sciences priority focus on Indigenous Health.
Objectives / Principles
The creation of an Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing at the University of Manitoba, Rady Faculty of Health
Sciences will build on the planning and development of Indigenous Achievement and Success for objectives and
principles currently underway. We have expanded our initial objectives to include actions that are reflective of the

We join other Centers within the University of Manitoba, such as the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation
and the Centre for Global Health, Dept of Community Health Sciences, in supporting research, education and
training, and health and social structures that support Indigenous equity and empowerment. The Objectives of the
IIHH are reflective of our commitment to address issues through current expertise and we anticipate that the
restructuring to an Institute will strengthen our ability to meet our objectives.

Organizational Principles:
Organizational principles are designed to help guide structures/businesses/organizations to meet the needs of the
people they serve or service.
The primary purpose of the proposed Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing is to:
•
•

provide service that meets the health needs of a diverse Indigenous community and culture in
Manitoba and Nunavut and
to support the University in Indigenous Achievement and Success.

We will build and support the organizational culture of the IIHH by incorporating Indigenous values, in partnership
with the Executive Lead, Indigenous Achievement and other Faculties, to build capacity within the academic
environment that will increase the potential for Indigenous Achievement.

•

Given our team's expertise in partnership-based research, education and training, and clinical health
service delivery with First Nations, Metis, Inuit, and/or Indigenous communities; students, learners
and new faculty members will gain valuable understanding regarding key issues facing Indigenous
communities as well as the importance and contributions of Indigenous peoples in Manitoba, Canada,
and the world.

Creating Pathways: Developing a full range of resources in Indigenous Health and for Indigenous
students for all Colleges within the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences
•

•

The IIHH operates an extensive student mentorship program in all areas of research, student support
and physician leadership and this helps to foster the development of interest and expertise in First
Nations, Metis and Inuit health research, education and service delivery.
The IIHH leadership and directors maintain relationships with Indigenous communities and with a
cadre of faculty mentors who are committed to support First Nations, Métis, Inuit students interested
in graduate and clinical work, and in all students interested in collaborative First Nations, Métis and
Inuit health research, education and health service delivery.

Forging Connections:
•

•

•

The IIHH offers international linkages through our International Indigenous Academic Health Network
jointly funded by the Office of International Affairs and the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, Max Rady
College of Medicine that offers student and faculty exchange programs with a focus on Indigenous
Health. We recently acquired a scholarship program funded by the Canadian Queen Elizabeth II
Diamond Jubilee Scholarships offers Canadian students the opportunity to undertake clinical training
and research in commonwealth countries for a minimum period of 3 months. We will grant 75 such
scholarships over the next 4 years.
The IIHH encourages our members to continue international collaborations and publications in high
quality peer-reviewed journals and conferences, raising the profile of partnership-based First Nations,
Metis, Inuit and/or Indigenous health research in general and IIHH and the University of Manitoba in
particular.
o The collective efforts of the Faculty and Institute members and our Indigenous community
partners have resulted in the document ‘A Framework Agreement for Research Engagement
with First Nations, Metis and Inuit Communities’ to facilitate collaborative relationships with
Indigenous communities
The IIHH remains committed to Knowledge Translation and to the integration of First Nations, Metis,
Inuit and/or Indigenous knowledge into models of health service delivery and health research
practices. To this end, we encourage our members to continue to publish their work nationally and
internationally in addition to presenting research at national and international conferences.

Building Community: The development of an Indigenous Traditional Medicine Garden will benefit all
staff and students of all Colleges at the Bannatyne Campus.
In summary, through all of our activities, the IIHH remains centrally committed to building and maintaining
productive and respectful partnership-based relationships with First Nations, Metis, Inuit and/or Indigenous
communities, to recruiting Indigenous students and scholars, to providing effective support and mentorship, and to
sharing and building knowledge internationally. As such, the Institute is uniquely suited to foster and promote the
aims of the University of Manitoba as outlined in the Strategic Plan (2015-2020).

319

2.2.2 Scope and Activities of the Institute
The scope of work of the IIHH will include collaboration that meets the requirements of the University in the pillars
of research, education and service, and will continue to foster partnerships and relationships with all interested
Faculties at the University of Manitoba.
At the central level of the Institute, the scope and activities envisaged are identified below:

Table 1: Scope and Activities of the IIHH

Historically, we have worked closely with the Office of the Executive Lead, Indigenous Achievement, with
Kinesiology, Social Work, Extended Education, Education, Arts and Sciences on research projects, committee work
or environmental scans. We have also collaborated with other Faculties such as Law and with programs in
Extended Education and Student Affairs such as the ACCESS Programs, Aboriginal Focus Programs and others in
raising awareness of Indigenous issues and building resource base for Indigenous Achievement.

2.2.3 Benefits and Opportunities
The most significant benefit of the creation of an Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing will be the
establishment of a single doorway to access Indigenous Health expertise at the Bannatyne Campus in RFHS, in
collaboration with established partnerships / relationships with Faculties at the Fort Garry Campus. At the IIHH, a
dedicated team of Indigenous and non-Indigenous faculty, staff and students will support the advancement of
Indigenous perspectives, scholarly work and activities that are fundamental in supporting and developing these
partnerships at the academic and Indigenous community levels.
Opportunities provided by having an IIHH include a comprehensive approach to Indigenous health, to traditional
healing practices, to the teachings of our Elders and Knowledge Keepers, as well as valuable education
opportunities through inter-professional education sessions, electives in communities, service learning
opportunities, rounds and lectures and clinical skills development. Given the need for comprehensive training
sites, engagement with First Nations, Metis and Inuit communities will provide opportunities for Interprofessional education case studies, community based research and the development of service models for
health care delivery.
An Institute Council - similar to other Department Councils - will be developed where all members would have an
opportunity to meet, discuss, and participate in decision-making around Institute priorities and programs.
Individuals will apply to become members by submission of a cover letter and CV to the Head of the IIHH as will be
discussed later in the proposal.
With access to the expertise of faculty and staff of the IIHH, Health Care learners and new faculty members will
gain valuable understanding of Indigenous historical and contemporary issues, will gain an understanding of key
issues facing Indigenous communities as well as the importance and contributions of Indigenous peoples in
Manitoba, Canada, and the world.
The IIHH Institute leadership and directors maintain relationships with Indigenous communities and with a cadre of
faculty mentors who are committed to support First Nations, Métis, Inuit students interested in graduate and
clinical work, and in all students interested in collaborative First Nations, Métis and Inuit health research,
education and health service delivery.
Peer supports for student members will include access to Indigenous scholars or scholars with expertise in
Indigenous Health in the same or supportive programs, and provides an early introduction to the benefits of inter
professional education and practice.
The proposed IIHH has ongoing relationships with Fort Garry’s Migizii Agamaik and the Office of the Executive Lead
for Indigenous Achievement and we are able to collaborate on celebrating our Indigenous students, mentors.
With our Elders and Knowledge Keepers, we are able to support each other and to raise awareness of the rich
culture, traditions and values of Indigenous Peoples’ in Canada.

321

3.0 Constitution
3.1 Organization and Governance
In general, the work of the IIHH is informed by the principles of collaboration, integration and innovation. The
principles for collaboration are consistent with the principles of engagement for any collaborative or participatory
project, and articulate the relevance of relationships, respect, trust and joint priority setting.
The IIHH will ensure that there are efficiencies of scale in the administrative functions and an enhanced awareness
of the expertise in Indigenous Health in the RFHS.
The organization and governance of the University of Manitoba is well defined; and has identified, as a strategic
priority, the need for enhanced opportunities for Indigenous Achievement and Success. To accomplish this goal,
the University requires the expertise of human and operational resources that have proven a sustainable resource
over successive years. Capacity in Indigenous issues exists throughout many faculties of the University of
Manitoba, and specifically Indigenous Health exists within the RFHS. The IIHH is well placed to enhance existing
opportunities in the Colleges, and to support the development of new and innovative methods of collaboration
and integration of Indigenous health research, education and service delivery for the RFHS.

Organizational and Governance Principles
The organizational and governance principles for the IIHH are respectful of the guidance expectations of the
University of Manitoba governance model and those of our Indigenous community.
1.
2.

5.

Recognition that relationship is central to meaningful and authentic engagement with First Nation, Metis,
and Inuit Peoples.
Shared respect, trust, and commitment to mutually empowered long-term relationships.
Acknowledgement of the Inherent rights of First Nation, Metis, and Inuit Peoples; the Treaty rights of First
Nation Peoples; and the diversity and distinct identities, histories, cultures, languages, geographies
between First Nation, Metis, and Inuit Peoples.
Within the relationships and engagements there will be shared authority, responsibility, and
accountability.
Address the priorities and needs of First Nation, Metis, and Inuit Peoples, and the University.

3.1.1 Organizational Structure
As of April 2015, the proposed IIHH was identified as a potential entity within the RFHS at the University of
Manitoba. This is reflective of a recognition of the critical value that the IIHH will bring to the RFHS and ultimately
to the university overall (see Figure 1, below).
The IIHH will assume responsibility for the administration, financial management, leadership and management
structures, reviewing applications for and identifying membership for the Institute, supporting inter-professional
education, supporting inter-disciplinary policy electives, supporting international Indigenous exchange programs,
and coordinating the activities of the specific units / streams of activity in the IIHH.
The organization structure recognizes that the Vice Dean, Indigenous reports directly to the Dean and Vice Provost
of the RFHS. The Vice-Dean is a leadership and academic role within the Faculty and is responsible for leading
those initiatives that will support the development of a comprehensive strategy and operational entity responsible
for Indigenous Health in the RFHS. It is proposed that the role of a Head of the IIHH be established as the
Leadership and Administrative Management for the IIHH, with the Executive Lead, Academics and the Executive
Lead, Health Services as Direct Reports to the Head. The Vice Dean, Indigenous will assume the role of Head, IIHH

322

and take a leadership role in further defining the roles and responsibilities of the Head of the IIHH to be consistent
with University structure.
We recommend to the RFHS leadership continue with one individual filling both the role of Vice Dean, Indigenous
and the Head of the IIHH on a go forward basis.

3.1.4 Current Relationships
The Institute is fortunate in that the current units have had a history of establishing working relationships with
multiple partners, both within the University and at the Community level. These relationships have evolved to
best suit the anticipated partnership deliverables.
The Institute members have an extensive network and relationships at multiple levels throughout the University.

3.1.4.1 Partnership Development between the University (Rady Faculty of Health Sciences,
Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing) and the Indigenous Communities
The Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing Centres have had long standing relationships with Indigenous
communities. The depth of the relationships through community engagement or involvement is dependent on
two issues: the funding arrangements between the university and the Indigenous organization; and on the

324

partnership relationship that has evolved based on the autonomy of the Indigenous organizations and the
mandate of the University units or departments.

The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC) has been a strong partner in the development of research partnerships,
sharing of knowledge for health care planning and the delivery of some direct services in the realm of health
promotion and disease prevention. The recent formation of the Manitoba First Nations Health and Social
Secretariat of Manitoba (FNHSSM) has established a strong policy arm for the First Nations that will support not
only the political networks through data sharing and analysis, but the development of direct health service delivery
models for First Nations in Manitoba.
Solid relationships with the Manitoba Metis Federation (MMF) through its Department of Health and Wellness
have allowed the development of several initiatives and projects, including a joint responsibility for the delivery of
the International Conference of Indigenous Health Knowledge Development Conference here in Winnipeg in
October of 2014. The partnership with MMF allowed the opportunity for the University and MFN CAHR to jointly
plan and deliver the Conference with the Manitoba Network Environment for Aboriginal Health Research (NEAHR)
as partner.
The Manitoba Inuit Association (MIA) represents less than one thousand Inuit who have relocated to Manitoba
from Nunavut and has primarily a policy analysis function in the province; however, also functions as an advocacy
unit for the 15,000 Inuit who seek healthcare and other services in Winnipeg that are not currently available in the
Kivalliq region of Nunavut. Through the established Board of Directors of the MIA supports the research project
partnerships and advocates for equity in health and social supports for urban Inuit.
All three organizations participated actively in the development of a recent companion document for the Office of
Research, entitled A Framework for Research Engagement with First Nations, Metis and Inuit Communities.

4.0 Management
As per the Organization Structure identified in Section 3, the Vice Dean, Indigenous / Head of the Indigenous
Institute of Health and Healing reports to the Dean and Vice Provost of the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences.
Financial responsibility for the Institute is vested in the Vice Dean, Indigenous.

5.0 Proposed Membership
Health and Healing includes collaboration and integration of all aspects of the physical, spiritual, intellectual and
emotional aspects of an individual. The health colleges alone cannot address this continuum and, as such,
members of the entire University community are invited, and encouraged to become members of the Institute.

Our initial membership has been identified in 3.3.1, and the cv’s of the leadership / membership were
included in the initial document – CV’s of Leadership. A critical component in establishing the
categories, levels and criteria for membership was the need to have a consultation process that engages
our Indigenous community as well as our academic community. Initial discussions with our academic
colleagues indicates that members should identify how they will support and enhance the work of the
Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing and the University of Manitoba overall.
A document identifying clear procedures for appointing members to the Institute will be developed and
provided to the Deans Council, RFHS for approval within six to twelve months and will include guidelines on how
members of the University community can interact with the Institute. We will continue to work on the
membership categories through our Committee structures and through the processes identified in 3.1.2 and 3.1.4.
Specific to the current groups of the IIHH, the work of the IIHH and its Leadership is supported by the membership
of the NMU Physician Leadership and Nursing groups specific to health service delivery, by the membership of the
Indigenous health research community through the activities in MFN CAHR, and by the mentorship of the
Indigenous student and education teams through the membership of the CAHE.
Additional memberships include groups and individuals that will participate on committees, in working groups,
task forces, and ad hoc committees or projects to address specific issues. A summary of the current relationships
and partnerships identify potential members for the group work required.
There is an established process for acquiring membership in the former Manitoba First Nations Centre for
Aboriginal Health Research (MFN CAHR) and the Centre for Aboriginal Health Education (CAHE).
Members of the university community may apply to become members of the Institute by submission of a cover
letter and CV to the Head of the Institute and a Membership Review Committee. The Cover Letter will detail why
the individual wants to be a member and what they will contribute. Specifically, this may include research, student
mentorship, or teaching. New applications for members will then be circulated to the Institute Council and will be
approved with a majority of the Institute Council in favor.
The membership of the Institute will include representatives from our current partnerships and a summary of
those relationships and partnerships follows.

5.1 Academic membership / affiliation in the Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing,
Rady Faculty of Health Science
5.2 Academic Membership / Affiliations – Criteria and Process for application

326

The Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing will seek a process for academic membership or affiliation within
the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences as indicated above. The intent is for the membership / affiliation to be viewed
as complementary to the current process for appointment within the respective Departments in the Colleges of
Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Dentistry and Rehabilitation Sciences.
It is our intent to build a cadre of affiliated faculty and staff in support of Indigenous Health. This will include
members from all departments in the Colleges of the FHS and those in other Faculties (ie Kinesiology, Social Work,
etc.) that may have collaborative partnerships or research collaborations with the initial members of the Institute.
It is our intent to utilize current university guidelines. We will seek guidance to establish and highlight the process
for membership /affiliation within the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences and within the IIHH, consistent with current
Academic Guidelines.
In addition to the Academic membership and affiliation process for the Institute, our relationship with University
faculty, staff, peers and student learners provides an opportunity to enhance those relationships through
membership in our Research and Education streams.

5.3 Privileges and Responsibilities of Membership
The privileges of membership include access to and engagement with colleagues with expertise in Indigenous
Health, access to peer mentors in Indigenous Health and opportunities for teaching and administrative roles that
will support and enhance academic career development through engagement in Indigenous Health education,
research, community engagement and / or health service delivery in Indigenous communities.
The responsibilities of membership are consistent with those responsibilities of host departments or faculties
throughout the university environment. It is expected that members will support peer, graduate and
undergraduate student mentorship; and a requirement to participate in teaching that illustrates the expertise that
individuals bring to the realm of Indigenous Health.
Participation as an engaged member in an Indigenous Institute Council will be expected to ensure active
engagement in the policy and operational issues that will enhance opportunities for faculty, staff and student in
Indigenous Health. This will include recognition and awareness of gaps in resources and supports, and the
development of interventions or actions that can assist in addressing those gaps.

6.0 Physical Resources
The Physical Resources associated with the Institute are all located on the University of Manitoba Bannatyne
Campus
Ultimately, we have assurance that the Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing will be re-located as a unit to
the ‘new building’ anticipated in several years. Currently, all of the components of the Indigenous Institute of
Health and Healing are housed in a variety of locations on Bannatyne Campus.
The Vice Dean, Indigenous and the Executive Lead, Academic, are situated at P122 – 771 Bannatyne Ave.
The Colleges Lead and Liaison (Director of Indigenous Health Integration) is situated in S206, 771 Bannnatyne Ave.
The Executive Lead, Health Services and the staff and operational service components of the J. A. Hildes Northern
Medical Unit (NMU) are currently on the sixth (6th) floor in the Basic Medical Sciences Building at Bannatyne
Campus. The NMU was formerly situated in the T Block at T162 on McDermot Ave which is currently under
demolition.
The former MFN CAHR occupies 2500 sq. ft. of research space on the seventh floor of the Buhler Research Centre.
MFN CAHR was established through the support of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, which lobbied federal
departments to secure a generous contribution to the Foundations for Health fundraising campaign. A 2001
infrastructure development grant from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and the Province of Manitoba also
facilitated in the development of MFN CAHR.

327

CAHE has relocated to S206 Basic Sciences Building as of December, 2016.
On site at the Bannatyne Campus, we are in the process of finalizing the development of the Traditional
Indigenous Medicine Garden. The outdoor classrooms and extensive knowledge sharing of our Elders regarding
the medicines in the garden will support teaching and learning opportunities for all Colleges within the Faculty, and
in particular, the current Electives offered at the Max Rady College of Medicine.
The Garden has been a collaborative effort between the Office of the Vice Dean, Indigenous, Rady Faculty of
Health Sciences, and the Office of the Executive Lead, Indigenous Achievement, Central Administration.
Future Requirements: IIHH has engaged in the planning for future space requirements to be included in the
overall plans for Bannatyne Campus. Indigenous Health space requirements have been considered when
developing plans for the new building at the campus. We have been assured that the planning for the new
building includes space for the Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing (IIHH).
As we complete our strategic and annual plans, we will seek funding for research through grant applications,
funding for program development through strategic calls for proposals from provincial and federal governments,
and will apply to the Faculty for permission to seek funding from external Foundations and other funding agencies
for any innovative growth in Indigenous Health education and service delivery.

328

The Northern Medical Unit and the Manitoba First Nations Centre for Aboriginal Health Research will continue to
maintain administrative autonomy over their individual budgets due to the revenue sources generated from their
respective programs. Currently, approximately $254,236 is allocated specifically for the Centre for Aboriginal
Health Education salaries and program activities.
The Northern Medical Unit’s revenue will be utilized to achieve its mandate to provide direct physician service in
underserved communities. The activities associated with the NMU’s operations include: physician remuneration,
physician and administrative travel, recruitment and retention efforts, community engagement efforts, program
planning, and administrative and operational support.
The Manitoba First Nations Centre for Aboriginal Health Research will utilize its revenue to its member’s research
efforts, by providing administrative, and operational support. This includes, but not limited to: Support Unit and
Research Navigation Services, Mentorship Program, administrative staff support, and IT support.
The Centre for Aboriginal Health Education’s activities centers around student support by providing social and
academic resources and programming; professional development opportunities and networking with other
students and faculty members; and providing a culturally safe environment.
Since the allocation of funding is made possible through the reallocation of existing Faculty/College resources no
new funding is being requested.

8.0 Statements of Support and Commitment

333

Report of the Senate Committee on Admissions concerning a proposal from the Faculty
of Agricultural and Food Sciences to revise the admission regulations for the Diploma in
Agriculture program (2017.02.21)
Preamble:
1. The terms of reference for this committee can be found at: http://umanitoba.ca/admin/
governance/governing_documents/governance/sen_committees/490.htm.
2. The Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences is introducing a set of advanced entry
admission requirements for students applying to the Diploma in Agriculture program. These
requirements would apply to applicants who have previous post-secondary study experience.
3. The proposal was approved by the Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences’ Faculty
Council on December 16th, 2016 and was endorsed by SCADM on February 21st, 2017.
	
Observations:
1. Current admission requirements only take high school grades into consideration; over the
past couple of years more than 30% of incoming students have previous post-secondary
experience.
2. Using a high school transcript to assess a student’s abilities is not necessarily appropriate
for applicants who have completed 24 credit hours or more of post- secondary study.
3. Since post-secondary performance is not part of the current admission requirements, the
possibility exists that students who are on academic suspension in other programs could be
eligible to apply.
4. The proposed requirements for students who have a completed a minimum of 24 credit
hours of post-secondary study are modelled from other programs at the institution that offer
both a direct entry and advanced entry option.
Recommendation:
The Senate Committee on Admissions recommends that the proposal to introduce a set of
advanced entry admission requirements for the Diploma in Agriculture program be approved
effective for the September, 2018 intake.

Respectfully submitted
Susan Gottheil, Chair, Senate Committee on Admissions

	

Comments of the Senate Executive Committee:
The Senate Executive Committee endorses the
report to Senate.

MEMORANDUM
Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences
256 Agriculture Building, University of Manitoba
Winnipeg, MB Canada R3T 2N2

07 February 2017

TO:

Ms. Susan Gottheil, Chair, Senate Committee on Admissions

FROM:

Dr. Jared Carlberg, Associate Dean (Academic), Faculty of
Agricultural and Food Sciences

SUBJECT:

Creation of an Advanced Entry Admissions Category for the Diploma in
Agriculture Program

On December 16, 2016 the Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences’ Faculty Council voted to
approve a recommendation from its Curriculum Committee regarding the creation of an Advanced
Entry Admissions Category for our Diploma in Agriculture program.
Background
Current admission requirements for the Agriculture Diploma require applicants to have a 60%
average in grade 12 Math, English, and Science. For students whose background is not reflective
of their potential there is the option for them to apply through a special consideration category.
In the last few years there has been an increase of students entering the Diploma program with
post- secondary education. Other faculties have criteria for admitting students with postsecondary experience and for direct entry from high school. Currently, the Diploma program has
no such pathway for students and students are submitting high school transcripts that are not
reflecting their true potential if they have taken over 24 credit hours of post-secondary studies.
Since we don’t have a pathway for these students it makes it difficult for qualified students to
apply for our program. It also opens up the opportunity for students who are on academic
suspension from other programs to apply for the diploma program as we currently don’t
recognize post-secondary performance.

335

Proposed Advanced Entry Eligibility Requirements for the Diploma in Agriculture
Program:
Applicants in this category will have fulfilled all Eligibility Requirements as described below.
Applicants who do not fulfill all Eligibility Requirements will be deemed ineligible for Advanced
Entry and must apply through Direct Entry or Special consideration.
Students must:
1. Complete a minimum of 24 credit hours from a recognized university or college.
2. Achieve a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 2.0 or higher




It is expected that these courses will be completed by the end of the April
examination period. Students who need to complete courses during the Summer
Session to meet the minimum 24 credit hour requirement will only be considered
for admission on a space available basis after all other eligible students have been
considered.
If the number of eligible candidates exceeds the available spaces, a cumulative
grade point average higher than the minimum may be required for admission.

Applicants who have completed less than 24 credit hours of post-secondary level coursework
will be considered for direct entry admission if they:




Meet the high school admission requirement.
Are in good academic standing.
Have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 on their university
coursework, and have not exceeded 24 credit hours of previous university
coursework.

336

Report of the Senate Committee on Admissions concerning a proposal from the Faculty
of Architecture to update the supplementary regulations for the Environmental Design
program (2017.02.21)
Preamble:
1. The terms of reference for this committee can be found at: http://umanitoba.ca/admin/
governance/governing_documents/governance/sen_committees/490.htm.
2. The Faculty of Architecture is updating the supplementary regulations for the Bachelor of
Environmental Design program. SCADM reviewed the sections of the regulations that contain
information on admission requirements for the program.
3. All changes were approved by the Faculty of Architecture Faculty Council on June 7th, 2016
and were endorsed by SCADM on February 21st, 2017.
	
Observations:
1. A number of minor grammatical and editorial changes were made.
2. Language was updated throughout the admissions section of the regulations to ensure it
was consistent with the current language normally being used in institutional admissions
documents.
Recommendation:
The Senate Committee on Admissions recommends that the proposal to update the
supplementary regulations in the Environmental Design program be approved effective for the
September, 2018 intake.

Respectfully submitted
Susan Gottheil, Chair, Senate Committee on Admissions

RE:

Environmental Design Program - Supplementary Regulation - Submission to SCADM

In follow-up to your email of 19 December 2016, requesting the following by 3 January 2017; and subsequent
to that, inclusive of follow up to your email of 13 January 2017, I am providing you with:
1.
2.
3.

A covering memo outlining the proposal.
A track changes version of the proposed change
A clean copy of the proposed change

I am providing the following information that provides revisions to our original memo (from J. Beddoes on 3
October 2016) in reference to changes to the Admissions and Structure of the Program including changes to
the Environmental Design Program: Architecture Master Preparation Option (ED AMP). This memo is now
inclusive of recommendations following my appearance at SCADM on 15 December 2016 and 12 January
2017. To review, two agenda items were to be reviewed by the committee, a) the admissions requirements
(inc. AMP) and b) the addition of EVDS 1670 to the admissions bulletin at the meeting .
We "pulled" the item regarding EVDS 1670 as our curriculum revisions, as vetted by SCCCC on October 26,
2016, have been returned to the Faculty for additional discussion.
In regards to the admission requirements, questions were raised regarding the use of Ul / ED within the
Admissions section of our Supplementary Program Regulations. The following summation is inclusive of
these recommendations of 15 December 2016.
Subsequently I appeared at the SCADM meeting of 12 January 2017, where our changes were approved.
However, a portion of our regulations that formerly lay within the Residency Requirement IV, was observed,
by SCIE, as relevant to ED AMP admissions information. (Section II). This memo now includes that text
(highlighted below as do the copies of the regulations attached.
To sum, changes to the Admissions/ED AMP portions of our supplementary requirements are inclusive of
the following:

Proposed Changes and Justification

I. Admissions and Structure of the Program

338

Paragraph 1 "To be co11sidered for admission ... ": Mi11or edits to grammar and the additioH of the link to the
Environmental Design Application lllformation Bulletin.
Paragraph 2 "The Bachelor of Environmental Design ... ": lllcorporation of "one qualifying year" as a component of a
program which will take students approximately four years to complete. The previous language expressing that the ED
program is a three year program was deemed misleading to students and led to the impression that the program was
shorter in d11 ration.
Description of offerings in the "Option Years" was included so that this paragraph provides students with a11 accurate
description of the curricular proceedings.
Paragraph .3 in the track changes version is incorporated into Paragraph 2.
Paragraph 3 (in the revised) "Of the approximately .. . " no changes; and Paragraph 4 "Students entering ... " 110 clumges.
The last three paragraphs in the old regulations were deemed redundant and descriptive and not applicable to a
document inclusive of supplementary regulations.
At the end of this section, the r~ference "Apply to University 1" has been changed lo "Complete 30 credit hours of
University Study".
II. Environmental Design Program: Architecture Master Preparation Option (ED AMP)
Addition of the paragraph 4 providing clarity as to the process for tlzose students registered in the ED AMP program
who wish to apply for graduate admission .
Link provided with direct access to the ED AMP Admissions Bulletin.
Addition of the following text:
Students seeking admission into Year 3 of the Program on the basis of work completed elsewhere must have the
equivalent coursework and scholastic achievement levels to be admitted. A por~folio review will be part of the admission
process along with a statement of intent (300 word maximum). Equivalencies to ED course requirements will be
determined by individual instructors of relevant courses and approved by the Enviro11111e11tal Design Chair.
Attached are a copy of the relevant portions of the regulations with track changes visible and a "clean" copy
of the relevant regulations.
Please let me know if you require additional information.

SUPPLEMENTARY PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS, STRUCTURE OF PROGRAM, DEGREE
PERFORMANCE REGULATIONS AND POLICY

I. ADMISSIONS and STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM
To be considered for admission into the Bachelor of Environmental Design Program all applicants must
have completed the required 30 credit hours of university level course work with an overall minimum
adjusted grade point average of 2.50. Successful applicants are likely to require an Adjusted Grade
Point Average well in excess of this minimum because admission is academically competitive based on
scholastic achievement. Please see the current Environmental Design Application Information Bulletin
at http://umanitoba.ca/studenUadmissions/media/env design bulletin.pdf for specific entry
requirements. The application deadline is March 1 of each year.
The Bachelor of Environmental Design Degree is a four-year program of studies consisting of one
qualifying year plus one year of common 'Foundation Studies' (ED2) followed by two years of 'preprofessional 'Intermediate Studies' (ED3 and ED4). The third and fourth years are referred to as the
'Option Years' and include Architecture, Interior Environments, and Landscape+ Urbanism. The
Bachelor of Environmental Design Degree Program requires students to declare a specific program
Option after the second year of studies (ED2) in the Environmental Design Program.
Of the approximately 100 students moving into the third year of studies (ED3), admission into these
Options will be divided equally. Students will be required to rank their Program Options in order of
preference (1 51 , 2nd, 3rd choice). The selection of students into these Options will be based on GPA,
Portfolio and a Statement of Intent.
Students entering the program should be aware that entry into the Options will be assigned on a
competitive basis, and that not all students will be placed in their first Option choice. Students who have
not successfully completed studios or more than one three-credit-hour lecture course from second year
will not be eligible for admission into the Option Years.
Complete 30 credit hours of university study.
Apply to Environmental Design
Option Selection

ED2 [via Option 1 (with 1000 level EVDS courses) or Option 2]
ED3 Arch Option or ED3 IE Option or ED3 L + U Option
ED4 Arch Option or ED4 IE Option or ED4 L + U Option

II. ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN PROGRAM: ARCHITECTURE MASTER PREPARATION OPTION
(ED AMP)
The Faculty of Architecture offers a Bachelor of Environmental Design Architecture Master Preparation
Option (ED AMP) for students who have a recognized first degree in either a non-design or a designrelated field of study and who have an interest in pursuing the graduate degree in Architecture. These
students may apply and be admitted through the Environmental Design Program where they will be
enrolled in the Environmental Design Program: Architecture Master Preparation Option. There are two
different streams available:
Stream One: ED Architecture Master Preparation Option 1 (ED AMP 1 - two years of study). For
those who have no formal design education and have a recognized undergraduate first degree (or are
currently enrolled in the final year of a degree program). In order to graduate students must complete
the ED 3 and ED4 Architecture Master Preparation Option (total of 66 credit hours). Upon successful
1

340

completion of all the requirements for this two-year program, students will be eligible to receive a
Bachelor of Environmental Design degree.
Stream Two: ED Architecture Master Preparation Option 2 (ED AMP 2 - one year of study). For those
who already have an undergraduate design degree (or are currently enrolled in the final year of a design
degree program) in an allied design field such as Interior Design or Landscape Architecture, and wish to
pursue studies in a graduate degree in Architecture. These students will be considered on a case-bycase basis for placement into the fourth year of Environmental Design Architecture Option, but will be
ineligible to receive the Bachelor of Environmental Design degree.
NOTE: Upon successful completion of the undergraduate ED Architecture Master Preparation Option
(ED AMP 1 and ED AMP 2), students who wish to continue into the Master of Architecture Program
must officially apply for graduate admission. Evaluation is based on the student's progress in either the
one or two-year ED Architecture Master Preparation Option, as evidenced in a portfolio submission,
GPA and a Faculty of Graduate Studies application.
Students seeking admission into Year 3 of the Program on the basis of work completed elsewhere must
have the equivalent coursework and scholastic achievement levels to be admitted. A portfolio review will
be part of the admission process along with a statement of intent (300 word maximum). Equivalencies to
ED course requirements will be determined by individual instructors of relevant courses and approved
by the Environmental Design Program Chair.
For further information on the ED AMP Option, please refer to the following website:

Report of the Joint Senate Committee on Joint Masters Programs between the University of
Winnipeg and the University of Manitoba

Preamble:
1.

For information on the powers and duties of the Joint Senate Committee (JSC), please visit
point #2 of the committee’s terms of reference which are available at:
http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/governance/sen_committees/50
3.html

2.

The Joint Senate Committee voted via email on the above dated to consider a proposal from
the Public Administration Joint Discipline Committee. The proposal was previously approved by
the Faculty Council of Graduate Studies on February 17, 2017.

Observations

1.

The Public Administration Joint Discipline Committee proposes to change the admission
requirements for the Joint Masters program in Public Administration (MPA).
In 2016 the Senates of the Universities of Manitoba and Winnipeg approved a revised MPA
program; however, the admission requirements were not amended in this proposal. The old
(current) MPA curriculum permitted applicants with a three-year general degree to be
admitted into the program with the understanding that they would complete 48 credit hours of
study in the MPA. Applicants with a four-year degree would be admitted into the program with
only 24 credit hours of required study. The revised MPA program will commence in
September 2017 and now requires that all students complete 36 credit hours of study.
Accordingly, the program would like to alter its admission requirement to no longer accept
three-year degrees (i.e. 90 credit hours) and defer to the admission standards set out by the
Faculty of Graduate Studies thus requiring four-year degrees (i.e. 120 credit hours).
Applicants with a three-year degree will not have completed sufficient study to be prepared for
a shorter MPA program of 36 credit hours.
MPA admission requirements will state:
1. Graduates of four-year undergraduate degree programs (or equivalent) from:
a. Canadian institutions empowered by law to grant degrees; or
b. Colleges and universities outside Canada which are officially recognized by the
Faculty of Graduate Studies.
2. Students who have completed the pre-Master’s program from the University of Manitoba
or from another university as described in points a) and b) above.

Undergraduate Program Revisions for the 2017-2018 Academic Year

The Asper School of Business submits the following undergraduate program revisions for
consideration . The motions for these revisions were passed at Faculty Council Meetings held
on December 9, 2016.

CHANGES APPROVED BY FACULTY COUNCIL ON December 9, 2016
I. H. ASPER SCHOOL OF BUSINESS Policy on Accommodations for Missed
Undergraduate Term Examinations (Formerly: Asper School of Business Policy on
Deferrals of Term Exams)
Moved by Faculty Council to approve the following course changes to the Policy
on Accommodations for Missed Undergraduate Term Examinations.
Reason for change: The Asper School of Business has had a policy on accommodations for
missing undergraduate term exam inations since 2002. This policy was subsequently revised in
2006 and again in 2011 mostly to update the list of events that qualified for accommodation . In
the Fall of 2016, a subcommittee of the Undergraduate Program Committee further revised the
document for three reasons:

1) To update the list of events that qualify for accommodation (including specifying the
executives of students groups who qualify, where necessary).
2) To indicate clearly that the policy is in addition the university's Final Examinations and Final
Grades Policy and not instead of.
3) To provide guidelines that the Associate Dean may use should there be a request for
accommodation pertaining to an event not listed in the document.
4) To clarify the language used in certain paragraphs.
The changes to the 2011 version of the document that the Asper School's Faculty Council
approved are shown in red.
(See separate attached document for policy.)

I. H. ASPER SCHOOL OF BUSINESS
Regulation on Accommodations for Missed Undergraduate Term Examinations
(Formerly: Asper School of Business Policy on Deferrals of Term Exams)
Preamble
To fulfill the I.H. Asper School of Business mission to provide undergraduate students “with the
opportunity to develop skills and acquire knowledge that will enable them to contribute
meaningfully as leaders in organizations”, students are encouraged to participate in student
government activities and student events. It is recognized that such participation may at times
necessitate a student to miss a term examination (defined as an exam, other than the final
exam, requiring the student to take the exam in person or in real-time online).
This regulation document defines what is and what is not an acceptable reason for
accommodations for missed term examinations in Asper School courses stemming from
participation in student government activities and student events. This regulation applies only to
term examinations, not final examinations, for which the University’s Final Examinations and
Final Grades Policy will apply. Further, missing a final examination requires applying for a
deferred exam via the Undergraduate Program Office.
The University’s below list of acceptable reasons that qualify for accommodation for missed final
examinations will also apply to term examinations in Asper School undergraduate courses. In
addition, this regulation document lists activities and events that qualify for accommodations
should students have to miss a term examination for participating in one of those.
i)
ii)
iii)

medical and/or compassionate condition
participation in an inter-university, provincial, inter-provincial, national, or international
scholastic or athletic event
religious obligations

Missing deadlines for submitting assignments or term work completed outside of class are not
eligible for accommodation under this regulation, as it is expected that the student could have
planned their schedule around the event or activity to complete the submission on time.
This document does not address the issue of participation marks in class. Losing participation
marks by not being in class is a measurable cost of attending or participating in student events
and conferences. It is up to the instructor to make an accommodation for class participation
marks if he/she sees fit.
Section 1.0 Requirements for Accommodation
1.1

In order to have an accommodation, a student must provide the professor with a written
request for an accommodation at least five working days prior to the date of the term
examination. At this time, the professor may require proof of attendance at the event. If
no application is received by the cutoff time, the professor is under no obligation to
provide an accommodation.

1.2

The exam must occur at the same time as the event or activity the student is involved in,

348

factoring a reasonable travel time to and from the event. Participation in an activity or
event must actually prevent the student from attending the exam. It is not acceptable for
students to apply for an accommodation on the grounds that they are involved in
organizing an event or activity that prevents them from studying for the exam or taking
the exam. No event is considered so significant that it precludes a student from studying
for an exam. Students are expected to manage their time and develop the ability to
prioritize their work.
Section 2.0 Events Qualifying for Accommodation
The students noted under each of the following events should be provided with
accommodations for missed term examinations provided they meet the eligibility requirements
listed above.

Change in Faculty Regulations Related to the Calculation of GPAs

In response to the Fall 2016 updates to the University policies on Grade Point Averages and
Repeated Courses, the Faculty of Engineering reviewed its current regulations for
consistency and compliance. As a consequence, the attached changes are being proposed to
Sections 3.5, 3.6, 3.8, and 3.16 of the Faculty regulations.
1. The most significant change concerns the calculation of Degree GPA, as defined in
Section 3.8. It is the Faculty’s current practice to include only the most recent grade
obtained in a course when determining DGPA. Aurora will, however, include all
attempts by default, which would require manual intervention by advisors to
subsequently exclude those other attempts. Entering these exclusions is both time
consuming and prone to potential errors. As a result the Faculty is proposing that all
attempts of relevant courses now be included in the DGPA calculation.
2. As a consequence of the proposed change to the DGPA calculation, Section 3.5 is being
modified to draw the attention of students to the fact that all attempts for any course
transferred into their Engineering program will now be counted. This is intended to
ensure that students are fully informed of the potential repercussions of any decision
they might make regarding the transferring of relevant elective courses.
3. With the introduction of the Limited Access rules under the Repeated Courses policy,
the Faculty wishes to draw the attention of students to the new policy and to make it
clear that selection of courses, as outlined in Section 3.6, is subject to that policy.
4. A small change is being proposed to Section 3.16 to clarify that Authorized
Withdrawals may be granted through the Faculty of Engineering Dean’s Oﬃce on
behalf of the Dean, rather than strictly by the Dean.

Memo

Additions are shown in bold-italics.
Deletions are struck out.

3.5 Procedure Regarding the Inclusion of Elective Courses Taken Towards a Student’s Degree
Requirements
Upon Admission Into Engineering
At the time of admission, students may choose to apply (transfer) some or all eligible non-Engineering
elective courses (i.e., complementary studies electives, science electives, free electives) taken prior to
their admission to the Faculty towards their current Engineering degree program. All attempts for
those selected courses shall be applied to the student’s degree program and included in the
calculation of Degree Grade Point Average (DGPA).
After Admission Into Engineering
Grades for all eligible courses (i.e., technical electives, complementary studies electives, science
electives, free electives) attempted following admission to Engineering shall be included in and applied
to a student’s current degree program.
Special cases for either circumstance may be considered at the discretion of the Faculty of
Engineering Associate Dean (Undergraduate Programs).

3.6 Course Selection
When arranging a program of study, a student must satisfy the following requirements:
1. All prerequisite and corequisite course requirements must be met.
2. All previously failed compulsory courses must be repeated. Students will require assistance with
registration due to a block on the AURORA registration system which does not allow repeats
automatically. Note that a student’s ability to register for a course in any given term is subject to
the University’s Repeated Course Policy.
3. Students are not normally allowed to repeat courses graded “C” or higher, except under special
circumstances with the approval of the Department Head, or for students in the Preliminary
Engineering Program, of the Associate Dean (Undergraduate Programs).
4. Failed elective courses may be repeated or replaced with alternative elective courses, however, all
attempts will be included in the Degree Grade Point Average (DGPA) calculation.
Prerequisite Course: A prerequisite course must have been completed with a “C” grade or better before
a subsequent course can be attempted. Under exceptional circumstances, a course instructor may waive,
subject to approval by the Department Head (or designate), a prerequisite requirement.
Corequisite Course: A corequisite course must be taken concurrently or before its companion course.
Under exceptional circumstances, a course instructor may waive, subject to approval by the Department
Head (or designate), a corequisite requirement.

3.8 Grading and Assessment
All grades awarded by instructors for undergraduate courses offered in the Faculty of Engineering are
reviewed by examiners’ boards, which comprise all of the instructors in the student’s program year. After
approval by department councils, grades are presented to the Faculty Council of Engineering for
acceptance. Grades are published succeeding subsequent to their approval by the Faculty Council of
Engineering.
Following are the descriptions of grade point averages used for evaluation at end of each of the terms
(Fall, Winter, and Summer):
Term Grade Point Average (TGPA)
The Term Grade Point Average (TGPA) is computed from all of the final grades in all undergraduate
courses completed during a given academic term.
Degree Grade Point Average (DGPA)
The Degree Grade Point Average (DGPA) is computed from the final grades obtained in all courses
attempted, including applicable courses transferred from other faculties and other institutions, as part of a
student’s current degree program. Where a course has been repeated or replaced by an approved
substitution or equivalent course, only the last grade all attempts shall be included in the computation.
Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)
The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is computed from the final grades in all undergraduate
courses attempted at the University of Manitoba and courses transferred from other faculties and other
institutions.
Dean’s Honour List
A continuing student who achieves a Term Grade Point Average (TGPA) of 3.50 or higher in their most
recent academic term will be placed on the Dean’s Honour List. The assessment is based on a minimum
of 12 credit hours completed in that term. In addition, a graduating student who achieves a Degree Grade
Point Average (DGPA) of 3.5 or higher in their final academic evaluation will graduate on the Dean’s
Honour List and receive a notation indicating this on their final term transcript.
Awards
A number of scholarships, bursaries and other academic awards are available to Engineering students.
For information concerning awards (prizes, scholarships, and bursaries), please visit the Faculty website.
umanitoba.ca/faculties/engineering

3.16 Withdrawal from Courses
The responsibility for initiating withdrawals rests solely with the student, and no voluntary withdrawals are
permitted after the deadlines for voluntary withdrawal without academic penalty (see the chapter, General
Academic Regulations and Requirements, of this Calendar). For documented medical or compassionate
reasons, Authorized Withdrawals may be permitted by the Dean’s Office, Faculty of Engineering.
A student who, after registering for courses, in any term, becomes ineligible to proceed in Engineering will
be withdrawn from his or her courses for the effective term as well as any subsequent terms, including
Summer Session.

Report of the Senate Committee on Instruction and Evaluation RE: Revised Academic
Regulations for Bachelor of Environmental Design, Faculty of Architecture
Preamble:
1.

The terms of reference for the Senate Committee on Instruction and Evaluation (SCIE)
can be found
at: http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/governance/sen_comm
ittees/502.html.

2.

At its meetings on October 27, 2016 and February 16, 2017, SCIE considered a
proposal from the Faculty of Architecture to revise several Academic Regulations for the
Bachelor of Environmental Design program.

Observations:

1.

The Faculty is seeking formal approval of revisions to various regulations under which
students are assessed in the program. The proposed revisions submitted by the Faculty
represent current standards and practices in the program that were not previously
considered by SCIE or approved by Senate.

Qualifications for Graduation
1.

The Faculty is proposing to change the number of credit hours required to complete a
Bachelor of Environmental Design degree from successfully completing 101 credit hours
of coursework to successfully completing 99 credit hours of coursework.

2.

A statement has been added to set out the circumstances under which a student would
be placed on Academic Suspension.

Dean’s Honour List
1.

The Faculty is proposing to increase the minimum Term Grade Point Average required
for eligibility for the Dean’s Honour List from 3.5 to 4.0, as per the current practice in the
Faculty. It was noted that the proposal to increase this requirement goes against the
general trend to make the requirement for the Dean’s Honour List less stringent. The
Committee supported this change based on the Faculty’s demonstration that on average
36% of the graduating class have been named to the Deans Honour List over the last 5
years.

Residency Requirement
1.

The Faculty is proposing that the number of credit hours required to meet the residency
requirement be reduced from 67 credit hours to 66 credit hours.

363

2.

The Faculty is proposing to include statements to specify the steps students are required
to take if they wish to take time away from the program, and then return to the program
after an absence.

3.

As recommended by SCIE, Section IV(2) has been removed, as this refers to an
admission requirement, not a residency requirement. This passage has been included in
the Faculty’s proposal to revise the Admissions and Structure of Program regulations,
which were considered by the Senate Committee on Admissions at its February 21,
2017 meeting.

Probation and Academic Suspension
1.

The Faculty clarified wording in point 2 to state that a student’s status is determined at
the end of the Fall and Winter examination periods.

Incomplete Term Work
1.

Several minor wording changes were proposed. A change was proposed specifying that
incomplete courses would be indicated with a letter grade of “I” where an extension has
been granted. It was recommended that the title of the regulation be changed from
Incomplete to Incomplete Term Work.

Recommendation:
The Senate Committee on Instruction and Evaluation recommends:
THAT Senate approve the revisions to the following academic regulations for the
Bachelor of Environmental Design program, Faculty of Architecture, effective upon
Senate approval:
• Qualifications for Graduation
• Dean’s Honour List
• Residency Requirement
• Probation and Academic Suspension
• Incomplete Term Work
Respectfully submitted,
Dr. Diane Hiebert-Murphy, Chair
Senate Committee on Instruction and Evaluation

Comments of the Senate Executive Committee:
The Senate Executive Committee endorses the
report to Senate.

Proposal for a Chair in Finance

On behalf of the I. H. Asper School of Business, Dr. Michael Benarroch has submitted a
proposal to convert the currently externally funded Bryce Douglas Professorship in Finance
to the Bryce Douglas Chair in Finance.
The policy on Chairs and Professorships specifies that:
(1)
Chairs are established to advance the University's academic goals and objectives;
(2)
Chairs be funded by way of an endowment or through annual expendable gifts for at
least five years, or by a combination of endowment and annual expendable gifts;
(3)
Chairs shall normally be attached to a department, faculty school, college, centre or
institute and the goals of the Chair shall be consistent with that unit;
(4)
The establishment of a Chair normally shall not be tied to the appointment of a
particular person;
(5)
Individuals appointed to the Chair shall normally have the academic qualifications
commensurate with an appointment at the rank of Assistant Professor, Associate
Professor, or Professor; and
(6)
The initial term of the appointment of the chair shall be 3 to 5 years, and if renewal is
permitted, such renewal shall be subject to a successful performance review and the
availability of funds.
The proposed Chair satisfies the above requirements. Funding will be derived from a $3
million endowment.
I support this proposal from the I. H. Asper School of Business and request that it be
presented to the Senate Committee on University Research for consideration and
recommendation to Senate and, in tum, the Board of Governors.

If you have any questions or concerns, I would be pleased to meet with you.

THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
REPORT ON THE REVIEW OF THE
CENTRE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS RESEARCH (CHRR)
Preamble:
1.

The Policy for Research Centres, Institutes and Groups, stipulates that all research
centres/institutes be reviewed by the Senate Committee on University Research (SCUR)
on a periodic basis but not less than once every 5 years. Accordingly, and following the
approval by Senate of this Policy, the Senate Committee on University Research
established a schedule for the review of all research centres/institutes.

2.

For each research Centre/institute identified for review, a sub-committee of the Senate
Committee on University Research was established. In accordance with the Policy, the
task of each sub-committee was to recommend to SCUR on whether a formal,
independent review committee should be struck to conduct a full review. If a subcommittee was of the view that a full review of a specific research centre/institute was not
warranted, it was further charged with recommending to SCUR on the continuance or
termination of the research centre/institute.

Observations:
1.

The review process followed that which is outlined in section 2.8 of the Procedure, and
involved a review of annual reports of the centre/institute as well as a report prepared by
the research centre/institute director which contained:
(a) A description of how and why the centre/institute has achieved or revised its original
objectives; a detailed listing of its research and training accomplishments; a current
membership list; and a detailed financial statement;
(b) a five-year plan which identifies future research directions and development
strategies;
(c) letters indicating continued support for the research/centre institute from appropriate
department heads and faculty/school deans/directors; and
(d) the names of individuals who could provide external assessments of the research
centre/institute.

2.

The membership of this sub-committee was as follows:
Chair: Dr. John Doering
Member: Dr. Liqun Wang
Member: Ms. Kathryn Marcynuk

381

3.

The assessment of the sub-committee is as follows:
(a) The extent to which the research centre/institute has fulfilled:
(i) The general objectives of research centre/institutes as stipulated under the
Policy:
The Centre for Human Rights Research (CHRR), herein after referred to as “The
Centre”, has fulfilled the general objectives of a research centre as defined under
the relevant governance policy. The Centre was established on April 1, 2012 and
has operated on a continuous basis since its inception. Human Rights (and
Social Justice) is one of the University’s Strategic Research Themes1.
Staff in The Centre include a Director, a Manager, and an Office Assistant (0.5
FTE). An Advisory Board, consisting of two faculty members from the faculties
of Arts, Law, Social Work, and Education advise the Director on matters relating
to policy for The Centre.
The Centre draws together approximately 45 faculty members spanning 12
University of Manitoba faculties as well as The University of Winnipeg and the
Canadian Museum for Human Rights.
(ii) Its specific objectives, as indicated on its establishment:
The Centre for Human Rights Research (CHRR), has the following mission:
to bring together people and organizations – both within and outside the
University of Manitoba – to:
• enhance interdisciplinary and collaborative research capacity;
• create richer training opportunities for students; and
• facilitate the fusion of research-driven knowledge, public policy and
intellectual debate on issues related to human rights and social justice.
And the following objectives:
•

•
•
•

Enhance interdisciplinary and collaborative research capacity in focus
areas: water as a human right; documenting human rights; Indian
residential schools and truth and reconciliation; and sexual and reproductive
rights;
Facilitate research-driven public debate on contemporary human rights
issues;
Create human rights research training opportunities for students; and
Work towards stable long-term funding.

To achieve these objectives, The Centre has undertaken research regarding:
drinking water as human right on First Nations communities, co-edited a book on
the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, and collaborated to established the
National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation. Researchers affiliated with The
Centre have produced 3 books, 6 book chapters, 10 academic papers, 1 course
curriculum, 4 videos, and 20 newspaper columns.

382

(b) Highlight past research training and funding of the centre. Discuss the
appropriateness of its proposed five-year plan for future research directions and
development strategies:
The Centre has provided training opportunities for 4 postdoctoral fellows (through its
collaboration with the H20 program), 15 Ph.D. students, 26 Master’s students, 65 law
students, and 35 undergraduate students. The Centre has been involved in a
significant number of research dissemination initiatives.
The Centre has received 1.95 M$ in research funds from the Tri-Agencies (i.e.,
NSERC, SSHRC, CIHR) since its inception. It has a baseline budget of 188 k$/yr. It
is worth noting that The Centre has 1.9M$ in external funding, which is larger than
the University’s investment to date of 1.6M$, yielding a net return on investment.
The Centre has put forward a five-year plan during a period of fiscal challenge for the
University. Despite assuming reductions to the baseline budget in future years, the
budget presented increases modestly over the next five years based on securing funds
from other sources.
(c) Its current and projected financial viability
The Centre notes that if it “is unable to secure more research grants that allow salary
cost recovery, it will be necessary to progressively eliminate some CHRR activities.”
The Centre goes on to note “So far, CHRR has leveraged more than $1 in external
funds for every $1 invested in the centre by the university. However, this is unlikely
to continue unless CHRR focuses on the science and health-related research that is
most likely to attract million-dollar grants rather than on the most pressing local and
international human rights issues.”
Recommendation:
The Senate Committee on University Research recommend to Senate:
THAT the Centre for Human Rights Research, be renewed for a term of 5 years, from April
1, 2017 through to March 31, 2022.

THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON UNIVERSITY RESEARCH 
REPORT ON THE REVIEW OF THE 
HEALTH LEISURE AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE RESEARCH INSTITUTE (HLHPRI) 
 
Preamble: 
 
1.    The Policy for Research Centres, Institutes and Groups, stipulates that all research  
 
  centres/institutes be reviewed by the Senate Committee on University Research (SCUR)  
 
  on a periodic basis but not less than once every 5 years.  Accordingly and following the  
 
  approval by Senate of this Policy, the Senate Committee on University Research  
 
  established a schedule for the review of all research centres/institutes. 
 
2.        For each research centre/institute identified for review, a sub‐committee of the Senate  
 
  Committee on University Research was established.  In accordance with the Policy, the  
 
  task of each sub‐committee was to recommend to SCUR on whether a formal,  
 
  independent review committee should be struck to conduct a full review.  If a sub‐ 
 
  committee was of the view that a full review of a specific research centre/institute was  
 
  not warranted, it was further charged with recommending to SCUR on the continuance  
 
  or termination of the research centre/institute. 
 
Observations: 
 
1.
The review process followed that which is outlined in section 3.3.1 of the Policy, and 
involved a review of annual reports of each centre/institute as well as a report 
prepared by each research centre/institute director which contained: 
 
 A description of how and why the centre/institute has achieved or revised its 
original objectives; a detailed listing of its research and training 
accomplishments; a current membership list; and a detailed financial statement; 
 a five‐year plan which identifies future research directions and development 
strategies; 
 letters indicating continued support for the research/centre institute from 
appropriate department heads and faculty/school deans/directors; and  
 the names of individuals who could provide external assessments of the research 
centre/institute. 
 
 

385

 
The membership of this sub‐committee was as follows: 
 
Dr. Tony Iacopino, Dean, College of Dentistry (Chair) 
Dr. Pawan Singal, Director Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences 
Dr. Robert Hoppa, Associate Dean, Faculty of Arts 

2.

 
3.

The assessment of the sub‐committee was as follows: 
(a) The extent to which the research centre/institute has fulfilled: 
(i)
the general objectives of research centres/institutes as stipulated 
under the Policy; and  
(ii)
its specific objectives, as indicated on its establishment; 
(b) The appropriateness of its proposed five‐year plan for future research 
directions and development strategies and; 
(c) Its current and projected financial viability 

 
 
The report does a very nice job of identifying the achieved objectives of the HLHPRI which are 
to facilitate, conduct and disseminate research to promote health, leisure and human 
performance.  This is being accomplished through multiple programs including the Research 
Seminar Series, Graduate Student Discussion Series, Research Day, In‐Motion Partnership, 
continuing education credit for professionals who attend HLHPRI events each year, and a series 
of workshops providing introductory research skills and knowledge for students, research staff 
and faculty members.  The Institute has shown significant progress over its lifetime and 
specifically within the last five years with regard to growth in the number of affiliates and 
graduate students as well as increased collaboration among affiliates and graduate students 
from the Faculty of Kinesiology and Recreational Management and Applied Health.   
 
Total grant and research contract funding has reached a significant level and seems to have 
stabilized at that high level during the last five years.  There has been significant growth in the 
number of publications (and publications in highly regarded journals) during the same reporting 
period.  This is an impressive record of accomplishment.  Even though the present Director (Dr. 
Todd Duhamel) is new in the role (beginning July 1, 2016), he appears to be providing effective 
immediate leadership.  Going forward, although the goals of the HLHPRI remain the same, and 
a five‐year plan as well as baseline funding support are very nicely laid out in this report, 
national and international networking in the recent past and in the future could be further 
emphasized.  More detailed development of the plan in this area may be useful for facilitating 
further growth of funding and publications.   
 
The report includes many strong letters of support that validate the value of the HLHPRI to its 
members and larger University.  The letter from Dean Douglas Brown of the Faculty of 
Kinesiology and Recreational Management (FKRM) is particularly incisive, instructive and 
constructive.  Among several suggestions, he is proposing to enhance synergies between “the 
activities of the Institute and the fundamental activities of FKRM” in the areas of research and 
graduate student education.  He is also proposing that the HLHPRI create a more distinct profile 
and greater presence.  In this regard, the subcommittee suggests additional discussions 
between the HLHPRI Director and the Dean to further develop the strategic plan going forward. 
While the Dean is willing to provide more resources to enhance programs in strategic areas, 
these areas should be clearly defined and agreed upon by all stakeholders.  This committee 
386

suggests that the plan could look at including specific steps and actions to ensure that the 
HLHPRI achieves significant national and international presence going forward.   
 
 
Recommendation: 
 
THAT the Health Leisure and Human Performance Research Institute (HLHPRI) be renewed for 
a term of 5 years, from June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2022.

THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON UNIVERSITY RESEARCH 
REPORT ON THE REVIEW OF THE

Observations: 
 
1.
The review process followed that which is outlined in sections 2.6 to 2.13 of the 
Procedures, and involved a review of annual reports of each centre/institute as well 
as a report prepared by each research centre/institute director which (as per section 
2.8 of the Procedures) contained: 
 
a) A description of how and why the centre/institute has achieved or revised its 
original objectives; a detailed listing of its research and training 
accomplishments; a current membership list; and a detailed financial statement;

2.
The membership of this sub‐committee was as follows: 
 
Dr. Andrew Halayko, Professor, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences (Chair) 
Dr. Gary Glavin, Associate VP Research, Vice‐President (Research & International) Office  
Dr. Jason Leboe‐McGowan, Professor,   Faculty of Arts  
 
 
 
 
 
389

 
3. The assessment of the sub‐committee was as follows: 
 
Extent to which the research centre/institute has fulfilled: 
(i)
The general objectives of research centres/institutes as stipulated under the Policy; and  
(ii)
Its specific objectives, as indicated on its establishment; 
 
MCNHR  is  the  only  Manitoba  research  centre  focused  on  collaborative  nursing  and  health 
research, and is integral to the academic and research mission of the College of Nursing, with Dr. 
Beverly Temple serving both the Associate Dean Research and, since January 2016, as Leader of 
MCNHR  (Dr.  Diana  Clarke  was  MCNHR  Leader  from  2011‐2015).  In  the  opinion  of  the  sub‐
committee there has been an effective transition of leadership that has retained continuity of the 
strategic  priorities  of  the  centre.  This  has  ensured  that  the  centre  is  meeting  the  general 
objectives  of  research  centres/institutes  stipulated  under  the  Policy  for  Research  Centres, 
Institutes and Groups. 
 
MCNHR is continuing to be successful in growing nursing research in Manitoba and is contributing 
to  a  growth  in  research  dollars  awarded  to  nurse  researchers.  Recent  underpinnings  for  such 
progress  include  strategic  partnership  development.  Letters  from  partners  laud  the  unique 
leadership of MCNHR in advancing and promoting high caliber research in the province. There is 
enhanced  collaboration  with  other  health  sciences  colleges,  facilitated  through  work  with  Dr. 
Peter Nickerson, Vice Dean Research, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences. This is fostering integration 
and utilization of existing research supports in the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences to promote 
research  and  research  training  in  MCNHR.  Through  such  initiatives,  in  the  opinion  of  the  sub‐
committee, MCNHR is meeting the specific objectives developed at inception and for 2008‐2015 
strategic plan. The centre is meeting the relevant and meaningful objectives set in its 2008‐2015 
strategic plan and is well positioned to continue an upward trajectory in the forthcoming 5 years. 
 
Past research training and funding of the centre.  Appropriateness of its proposed five‐year plan 
for future research directions and development strategies; 
 
In  the  five  year  period  from  2011‐2015,  members  of  the  MCNHR  have  published  341  peer 
reviewed publications, 30 book chapters and 7 books. From 2011‐15 MCNHR members submitted 
261  grant  funding  applications,  with  a  mean  success  rate  of  57%  (peak  success  67%  in  2012; 
success in 2015 57%). Since revising its membership categories in 2011, MN students and PhD 
students with advisors from College of Nursing thus are granted automatic MCNHR membership 
as Graduate Student Affiliates. The MCNHR has 111 graduate students from the Masters and PhD 
Programs  in  the  College  of  Nursing,  the  PhD  Program  in  Applied  Health  Sciences  and 
Interdisciplinary PhD Programs. In the opinion of the sub‐committee, the MCNHR and its members 
demonstrate excellent achievement in graduate training, research productivity and in acquiring 
external grant funding.  
 
MCNHR appears to be playing a needed and critical leadership role in building nursing research 
capacity  across  the  province,  concomitantly  fostering  and  promoting  student  engagement  in 
research. In appended letters, MCNHR faculty members specifically acknowledge assistance with 
grant  applications  and  awards  as  being  a  crucial  benefit  in  fostering  success.  This  includes 
enhancements for academic and professional development of students to the benefit of research 
programs and, of course, the students. Overall, there is significant evidence that resources within 
the MCNHR are directly contributing to increasing research activity and the quality of scholarship 
390

in nursing research. The new plan includes a cohesive and feasible set of objectives and initiatives 
that  should  support  continued  growth  in  multiple  areas,  including:  Conduct  of  Research; 
Knowledge Translation; Collaborations in Nursing and Health Research; Visibility of Research; and 
Research Training. 
 
 
The new plan includes initiatives to promote stronger integration of the MCNHR with the College 
of Nursing and the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences. This will be engendered by the dual role of 
MCNHR leader, Dr. Temple, as CP Research in the College of Nursing. As highlighted in the new 
plan, integration is critical given expectations for significant faculty renewal (retirement) in the 
next  five  years,  thus  the  new  plan  will  position  MCNHR  to  support  new  researchers  in  an 
increasingly  competitive  grant  funding  climate,  and  as  a  “carrot”  to  attract  promising  new 
researchers, and perhaps established researchers to the College of Nursing. One piece that is not 
fully developed in the new plan is the establishment of a formal mentorship program for new 
recruits affiliated with the MCNHR. In the opinion of the sub‐committee, MCNHR could explore 
developing a mentorship plan for existing and future new faculty recruits, perhaps investigating 
means of integration with existing programs in the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences and institute 
partners (eg. Children’s Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba).  Success in the new plan is also 
linked  to  a  vision  of  building  interdisciplinary  collaborative  teams  across  Colleges  in  the  Rady 
Faculty of Health Sciences, thereby advancing capacity of MCNHR, its researchers and trainees, 
to address health issues from the cell and molecular level to knowledge translation. This it to be 
further supported by emerging partnerships with platforms at the George and Fay Yee Centre for 
Health  Care  Innovation  to  build  knowledge  synthesis,  knowledge  translation  and  patient 
engagement platforms in MCNHR. Overall, the new plan identifies strategies to increase impact 
of limited resources, expand on partnerships, and for critical assessment of areas for investment 
and  expansion.  In  the  sub‐committee’s  opinion  the  new  plan  is  consistent  with  the  Policy  for 
Research  Centres,  Institutes  and  Groups,  and  aligns  with  strategic  plans  of  the  University  of 
Manitoba, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, and the College of Nursing.  The Centre may want to 
explore  adding  external  persons  to  the  advisory  board.    The  Centre  could  also  consider  semi‐
annual  advisory  board  meetings  that  could  include  members  external  to  Manitoba  to  ensure 
ongoing  assessments  and  guidance  in  refining  strategic  decisions  and  recommendations  are 
provided.  
 
Current and projected financial viability. 
From its Operating Budget, the College of Nursing Operating Budget supports MCNHR operations 
with  approximately  $250,000  annually.  This  is  associated  with  over  $1.5  million  of  annual 
external research support that is administered annually by the College of Nursing. In the opinion 
of the sub‐committee this is very good return on investment. From the Indirect Costs Program 
(ICP), the College of Nursing also directs approximately $25,000 ‐ $40,000 annually to the MCNHR 
to  expand  and  support  research  grant  proposal  development  services  for  faculty  members. 
MCNHR has developed an Endowment/Trust Income account that provides sufficient investment 
income to support up to 2 Research Grant applications of up to $7,500 annually. MCNHR also 
provides  research  services  (research  assistance  services,  project  coordination,  online  survey 
administration, and statistical consultation) on a fee‐for service basis that generated $316,475 
income between 2011 and 2015 (~$81,000 in 2015). In the opinion of the sub‐committee, the 
current and planned financial plan for sustainability is not at risk or in jeopardy of catastrophic 
collapse.  The  sub‐committee  suggests  that  MCNHR  consider  playing  a  lead  pro‐active  role  in 
facilitating  and  supporting  members  for  success  in  obtaining  significant  external  awards  for 
research and scholarly infrastructure (eg. Canada Foundation for Innovation; CIHR network/team 
391

grants).  Success in this area will create core resources to the benefit of many MCNHR members 
– faculty and students. 
 
Recommendation: 
  
THAT the Manitoba Centre for Nursing and Health Research be renewed for a term of 5 years, 
from April 1 2017 through March 31, 2022.

Recognition and Educational Services Agreement between the University of Manitoba (the
“University”) and the International College of Manitoba (“ICM”)

PREAMBLE
1. In 2007, the University entered into ten-year agreement with Navitas Canada Holdings Limited
(“Navitas”), a company wholly owned by IBT (Canada) Pty Ltd, a 100% subsidiary of Navitas Limited
of Australia. In Manitoba, the company operates as the International College of Manitoba (ICM). On
October 20, 2011, Navitas’ name was changed to International College of Manitoba Limited.
2. The current agreement between the University and ICM expires on December 31, 2017.
3. The President committed that any proposed renewal of the agreement with ICM would come before
Senate for approval.
4. The University and ICM completed a progress report and evaluative review of the ICM Program (the
“ICM Review Document”) together with an in-depth review of the current agreement. Based on this
review, the University began the process of discussing the terms and conditions of a renewal that
would replace the existing agreement and extend the relationship between the University and ICM.
5. The relationship between ICM and the University has grown and matured over the last 10 years.
While there have been challenges, the relationship has proven to be viable and beneficial for the
University community. An improved, more comprehensive agreement, that specifically addresses
previously raised issues, will provide for an enhanced operational framework that will build upon
the current relationship and allow for improvements moving forward.
OBSERVATIONS
1. Relationship between the University and ICM
•

International College of Manitoba Limited, trading as International College of Manitoba, is a
company duly incorporated under and pursuant to the laws of the Province of British Columbia,
registered to conduct business in the Province of Manitoba, and wholly owned by Navitas.

•

The relationship between the University and ICM is governed by contract. The University and
ICM are not partners, joint venturers or members of a joint enterprise, nor is the relationship of
principal and agent created. The proposed agreement is now explicit that the arrangement
between the University and ICM is not a partnership. Therefore, ICM bears the financial and
legal risk for offering the ICM Program. The fees paid to the University are not based on the
profitability of the ICM Program (or ICM in general); they are fixed percentage fees stipulated in
the agreement.

395

•

Pursuant to the agreement, ICM recruits and offers a range of academic and other supports to
international students who, because of English language proficiency and/or academic standing,
would not ordinarily be eligible for direct admission to the University. The University provides
services and facilities in support of ICM’s teaching and learning role, for which ICM pays a
royalty fee. The University also provides academic oversight of the university-level courses
offered by ICM. The objective of the agreement between the University and ICM is to increase
the quality, quantity, preparedness, success, and diversity of international students attending
the University.

2. ICM Program
•

Details of the ICM Program are set out in the ICM Review Document. To summarize, there are
two programs offered by ICM:
o

o

University Transfer Program I (UTP I), designed to help students who have not achieved
results deemed equivalent to Manitoba grade 12, and to meet UTP II entry
requirements. Completion does not provide credit toward a degree at the University;
and
University Transfer Program II (UTP II), university-level courses based on our
curriculum, taught and moderated by University-approved instructors, and assessed by
University academic units as equivalent to their first-year courses.

•

The ICM Program is designed to address the unique challenges of international students. It
provides the acclimatization that they require, thereby ensuring their academic and social
readiness for continued success in university-level studies. The program comprises study skills
development embedded within rigorous academic course content, high levels of social and
academic support and intensive English language instruction, if required.

•

To ease students’ transition to the Canadian academic environment, the ICM Program provides:
o small class sizes and additional instruction time;
o a high degree of interaction between the instructors and students; and
o adaptive instruction with a strong emphasis on group work, presentations and peer
assessment.

•

To further enhance student success, the ICM Program places strong emphasis on academic
honesty and learning in a Canadian environment. This is augmented by psycho-social supports
to aid students in adapting to their new environment and developing healthy social networks.

3. Alignment with Institutional Priorities
•

The ICM Program was introduced prior to Taking Our Place: The University of Manitoba
Strategic Plan 2015-2020. However, the University’s relationship with ICM and the ongoing
program strongly supports the second goal under ‘Inspiring Minds through innovative and

396

quality teaching’, that is, to ‘Optimize enrolment with an appropriate mix of undergraduate,
graduate, Indigenous, and international students for Manitoba’s research university.’
•

ICM’s enrollment has grown from an initial intake of 33 students, in September 2008, to
approximately 1,300 by September 2016. This growth has contributed to the University meeting
and surpassing its initial international student target of 10% of total undergraduate enrolment—
this target is now in the process of being revised. By November 2015, international students
comprised 16.2% of the UM student population and ICM graduates made up 20% of these
students.

•

It should be noted that while the initial rate of growth in enrolments has slowed, current
international events—most notably the effect of Brexit and the recent American elections—may
result in increased international student interest and enrollments generally in Canada. This is
addressed in the proposed agreement by introducing a mechanism to review enrollment targets
annually going forward.

•

The ICM program has played a significant role in increasing the number of international students
on campus, increasing the diversity of the international student population, and through the
success of these students strengthening our international reputation as a provider of relevant
and high quality programs.

4. Financial Benefits to the University
•

The University of Manitoba, along with all publically funded institutions in Manitoba, is facing a
future of significant funding and budgeting challenges, along with potentially mandated fiscal
restraints. For some, the preference may be to create an internal program that would hopefully
create the same results as the ICM Program. However, the costs that would be incurred to
create, resource, and maintain such a complex program internally would be beyond the current
abilities of the University. ICM is an international company that specializes in bridge
programming for international students who want to study abroad. The relationship between
the University and ICM has proven to be positive, both from a program outcome and a financial
perspective.

•

In the context of provincial funding constraints, revenue generated from the agreement with
ICM provides additional flexibility for participating units to invest in needs, such as graduate
student support. For the broader University, the availability of these royalties facilitates the
realization of more strategic projects, such as the Learning Commons development. It should be
noted that ICM royalties do not cover UTP II course delivery costs, such as consumables,
instructors, TAs and graders—these are paid by ICM. As well, the revenue provided by the ICM
Program to date needs to be considered in the context of the strong enrolment growth
experienced since inception in 2007 to December 2015. At current enrolment levels, these
revenues will accumulate significantly.

397

•

•

Revenues generated by the University from the agreement with ICM are significant. Financial
contributions to the University are three-fold and set out in more detail in the ICM Review
Document:
o

Royalty Fees: Each term ICM pays royalty fees to the University in the form of a
percentage of ICM gross revenues, as specified in the Third Schedule of the proposed
agreement. The royalty fees paid to the University are over and above payments made
to the English Learning Centre (ELC), and for the professors teaching ICM courses, which
are paid directly by ICM. Since the inception of ICM, the annual contract royalty
payments have continued to grow, with the 2016 annual payment reaching $4.1 million.
Royalty fees during the period covered by the accompanying report, 2007 to December
2015, accumulated to $14.4 million. Including the most recent remittance in January
2017, royalties since September 2008, have now accumulated to $18,217,388.

o

Other Fees: Each term ICM pays agreed fees to the University for ICM student access to
the University for a variety of student services, including access to the University
libraries and recreation facilities. ICM students also pay a technology fee each term.

o

Tuition: ICM students that subsequently transfer to the University generate significant
revenues through tuition and the differential fees payable for the duration of their
undergraduate degree studies at the University. Since these are students who would not
otherwise have been admitted to the University, these follow-on fees are truly
additional revenues for the University. The registration of qualified students from the
ICM program at the University from 2008 – 2016 has resulted in over $47.1 million in
revenue for the University.

The revenues generated by the University under the agreement benefit the University
community in many ways, including:
o University faculties are reimbursed from the fee payments for delivering courses in the
UTP II program. $3.4 million of the revenue has been transferred directly to faculties
during the period of 2008-2016.
o $8.6 million of these fee payments have supported capital projects such as the Learning
Commons, upgrades to St. Paul’s College and renovations to the Fitzgerald Building.
o The technology fee has accumulated to $876,913, which has been directed to the
Technology Endowment Fund and, used for the repayment of loans taken for larger
projects, such as the campus WIFI project.
o Future revenues flowing from ICM royalties, assuming steady state enrolment at the
current level, have the potential to address a number of high impact strategic initiatives
over the term of a new contract.
o ICM also contributes revenues external to the current agreement, for example,
 Through the recently negotiated membership of ICM students to the UM Active
Living Center—this has been built into the new contract.
 To December, 2015, ICM has contributed approx. $2,958,646 to the ELC and IEP
programs for English language instruction.

398





Contribution to instructors’ salaries from inception (2007) to end of current
term exceeds $10,000,000. Currently, 84% of ICM’s instructors teaching UTP II
courses are teaching or have taught for the University or another Manitoban
university. This additional income is important to these instructors, some of
whom are graduate students in University programs.
Contributions to Student Residences arising from ICM student use of those
facilities has accumulated to $2,200,000.

5. Discussion about the ICM Program
While offering a number of benefits, the operation of ICM at the University has presented some
challenges, which are listed below. These challenges have been the subject of discussion during
annual presentations to Senate addressing ICM operations and periodically in discussions with ICM
through the International College of Manitoba and University of Manitoba Academic Advisory
Council (“AAC”).
Questions
A number of questions have been asked about the quality of the ICM Program and students, which
are addressed below:
•

Non-Preferential Program Access: ICM students who successfully complete 30 credit hours
of UTP II courses are eligible to apply for admission to University undergraduate degree
programs, subject to meeting all admissions requirements, including those for specific
university-level courses, and meeting the minimum GPA levels required for admission to the
relevant program, on the same basis as all other international student applicants. No
guarantee of admission to competitive entry programs or those subject to an international
quota is provided. As such no preferential program access is provided; ICM graduates have
to compete on merit, particularly in programs such as Engineering and Asper that limit
international student admissions.

•

Quality Assurance: The proposed agreement contains provisions to ensure the integrity of
the ICM Program:
o University Departments or Faculties provide oversight and liaise with ICM to ensure
that UTP II courses conform to University academic standards. They also ensure that
instructors are properly qualified and that assessment procedures are appropriate.
o Course results are reviewed by the AAC each term and reported to Senate annually.

•

Academic Integrity: There is some evidence, both within the University and other
universities within Canada, that the incidence of academic misconduct, relative to domestic
students, tends to be higher on average among international students as a cohort.
Notwithstanding, there is no definitive evidence that ICM graduates experience rates of
academic misconduct higher than the rest of the international student cohort at the
University. This is posited as arising from a variety of factors related to cultural norms,
language attainment, and adaptation to a very different educational setting in Canada.

399

ICM takes issues of academic misconduct seriously and works hard to ensure students are
taught how to appropriately cite and collaborate on academic work. Students are provided
this information at pre-departure (prior to arriving in Canada) in the ICM Student Handbook,
upon arrival at orientation, in a specialized introductory class (ILS-Interactive Learning
Series) mandatory for all students, at the start of each course, in workshops offered during
the term, and on a remedial basis, as necessary.
In addition to education about appropriate academic conduct, ICM provides advising
supports and study and organizational skills instruction to help their students adapt to the
Canadian environment.
As noted in the Review document, academic misconduct at ICM is recorded as first, second,
and third offense, with penalties associated with each.
Academic misconduct statistics are reviewed each term at the AAC, and prior to the
introduction in 2015 of a mandatory workshop for students submitting plagiarised materials
(at the request of AAC), academic misconduct was reported for, on average, 4-5% of
students in ICM courses (with 80% first time offences, dominated by plagiarism and
inappropriate collaboration). During the Fall 2016 term, twenty-eight ICM students were
linked with incidents of academic misconduct, representing approximately 2.16% of ICM
student population, down from 4.40% in the previous term. AAC will continue to monitor
this behavior.
ICM graduates transferring to the University become part of the broader body of
international students and, as such, are included in discussions about the experience of a
relatively higher incidence of academic misconduct amongst international students.
•

Academic Performance: Outcomes for ICM Graduates entering the University compared to
other the University international students, for the period from inception to December 2015
are presented in the accompanying ICM Review Document. As well, comparative GPA
statistics are presented annually at Senate. The available evidence suggests that on
aggregate ICM graduates perform about as well as other international students with respect
to progression, graduation, and GPA. However, while we continue to undertake this
exercise, there are significant differences between ICM students and international students
admitted directly to the University. As opposed to the latter, prior to entering the University
programs ICM students have not met the University required admission standards—that is
the purpose of the UTP II program. Additionally, when comparing progression data it needs
to be recognized that ICM students are not able to transfer in courses from previous work
completed at international universities (because of the aforementioned eligibility issue), as
such, time to completion, on average, would be expected to be longer than that of
comparison group.

Improvements to Agreement
Concerns were raised about the current agreement with ICM that have been addressed in the
proposed agreement:

400

•

Academic Freedom: a section has been added to the proposed agreement recognizing the
importance of academic freedom within the ICM Program, and whereby ICM commits to the
principles of academic freedom.

•

Recruiting Practices: The proposed agreement places an obligation on ICM to inform
students that they are not students of the University. Further, on January 1, 2016, The
International Education Act (“IEA”) and its associated regulations, including the Code of
Practice and Conduct Regulation (the “Regulations”) were introduced. The IEA has two
main purposes:
o to protect international students attending educational institutions in the province
from potential fraud and negligence; and
o to promote Manitoba’s reputation as a high quality destination for international
study by providing a measure of quality assurance through the IEA.
ICM is a designated education provider under the Act. Not only is ICM legally compelled to
comply with the Act and Regulations, it is also responsible for conveying the contents of the
Regulation to their staff recruiters and to the contracted agents associated with ICM.

•

ICM use of facilities and resources: Recognizing that the use of University facilities and
resources increases with ICM student enrollment, the proposed agreement gives the
University control over maximum levels of student enrollment. This is important for the
University to manage available facilities and resources. For 2015-16, ICM programs were
assigned 10 full day (8 am to 10 pm) and 4 half day (1:30 pm – 5:30 pm) classrooms. The
former were located in the Fitzgerald Building (5), St. Paul’s College (4), and the Education
Building (1). Classroom assignments for the latter were accommodated in Education,
Russell, Tier, Architecture II, Machray Hall, Engineering II, and St. Paul’s College (most rooms
are used only one afternoon per week). The University Registrar has noted that we have
sufficient teaching space inventory to accommodate the ICM programs.

•

Intellectual Property: the proposed agreement reaffirms that ownership of course materials
and any other works produced by University instructors are governed by the collective
agreement (or University Policy in the case of a non-UMFA member).

•

Financial expense to the University: Instructional space rental costs paid to both St. John’s
and St. Paul’s colleges total just over $222,000 from 2008 to 2016. Other expenses include
audiovisual equipment rental, as well as other minor expenses totaled less than $35,000
over the period. Combined, these expenses represent roughly 1.8% of the total revenue
collected during the period. Although overhead costs exist as part of the ICM program,
these are mainly fixed expenses such as amortization, principle and interest, electricity, and
heating expense, which would exist without ICM. Further, the proposed agreement charges
ICM for flow-through utility charges assessed to other units on campus (e.g. telephone and
postage), and rental rate charges should the royalty fees payable to the University fall below
a threshold of equivalent value.

401

•

Risk Management: Robust risk management provisions have been added to the proposed
agreement to mitigate financial and/or legal risk to the University, such as:
o Expanding the scope of the indemnity and insurance clauses;
o Terms and conditions around use of the facilities, including protections for the
University with respect to assignment and relocation of space, retention
of ownership, reasonable use, damage to property, liens, and prohibition
of assignment or subletting of space.
o a minimum fee payable to the University based on usage of administrative square
footage;
o the ability to terminate the agreement under specified terms and conditions, such
as default.

6. ICM Review Document
•

To support Senate’s discussions about the agreement, a comprehensive report on ICM’s
operations since inception has been prepared and is included herewith.

•

The report outlines the mechanisms in place to ensure that all course features related to design,
delivery, and assessment meet University standards and equivalency. The course moderation
process provides for departmental review and approval of instructor credentials, course syllabi,
examinations, and final grades.

•

The report also outlines a variety of outcomes, including those related to students’ academic
performance within the ICM Program, benchmarks against other cohorts of students, instructor
attitudes, and student satisfaction.

•

Lastly, the report sets out the financial contributions of the ICM Program to the University.

7. Conclusion
The University and ICM completed a progress report and evaluative review of the ICM Program and a
thorough analysis of the current agreement, taking into consideration how the ICM Program and
arrangement between the parties has matured and changed since 2007. The University considered
things such as:
•
•
•

The increased student enrollment (and therefore increased use of facilities);
Fine tuning and changes to program administrative that have occurred over the years; and
The role of the committees and lines of communication.

The University also looked back on previous concerns raised by the University community over the
years.

402

It was important to ensure that the ICM Program and proposed agreement:
•
•

Not only protects the University from legal and financial risks;
But also reflects the realities of the current arrangement and addresses concerns of the
University community.

The relationship between the University and ICM is essential to providing a learning environment rich
with diversity and opportunity. Having a successful and recognized program onsite at the University that
provides international students with a pathway to post-secondary education is fundamental to the
future success of many international students.
The relationship between the University and ICM has been enhanced through a mutual program review
that recognized and acknowledged the past and ongoing challenges faced by both institutions. With this
in mind, and with a more robust and comprehensive agreement in place, we can move forward with
compatible goals and approaches to success.
8. Recommendation
That the Senate recommend the Recognition and Educational Services Agreement between the
University of Manitoba and ICM be renewed.
Respectfully submitted,

Janice Ristock,
Provost and Vice-President (Academic)

Comments of the Senate Executive Committee:
The Senate Executive Committee endorses the
report to Senate.

403

The structure of the new Agreement closely mirrors that of the one currently in place, with several
important additions. The following provides a section-by-section summary of highlights.
Current Agreement

Proposed Agreement

RECITALS
The section includes three enumerated elements
which indicate that:
• The Pathway will offer a range of
educational services and the University will
provide facilities and services, in
consideration for which ICM will pay fees;
• Pathway students that successfully complete
UTP II will be eligible to apply to the
University and receive Transfer Credits; and
• This agreement will form the basis of the
relationship.
SECTION I – Definitions And Interpretation
The section provides definitions for 23 different
terms used throughout the agreement.

The renewed Agreement reiterates the prior
recitals and adds a new one noting that this
agreement replaces the agreement currently in
effect.

The same terms appear in the proposed
Agreement.
Two have been renamed for added clarity:
• “Semester” becomes “Term;” and
• “Program” becomes “University Program.”
Five additional terms have been added:

A clause on interpretation is included to clarify
how the agreement is to be understood.

• “Facilities,” in reference the new Schedule
Six (see below);
• “ICM Programs,” to differentiate from
University Program;
• “JSAB,” in reference to the new entity in
Section Seven (see below);
• “Mandatory Fees,” reference those paid by
all students for access to services and

Executive Summary
The International College of Manitoba (ICM) delivers pathway programs for primarily international
students who would not normally qualify for direct entry to the University of Manitoba (UM). ICM
students who successfully complete the ICM program are eligible to apply for transfer to UM and if they
meet prescribed admissions criteria will be granted transfer credits for university courses completed at
ICM. While at ICM, students pursue their studies in a supportive environment that includes small class
sizes, extended teaching hours, additional learning assistance and social-emotional support in their
transition to living and studying in Canada. ICM’s intensive learning experience familiarizes students
with Canadian university teaching and learning styles, academic expectations, writing standards, and
English language usage. Students also receive help in locating housing and assistance in adapting to the
Canadian culture and the University’s learning environment. ICM helps students who are far from
friends and family, and who are often living on their own for the first time, to build the supportive social
networks that are necessary for success in postsecondary studies.
ICM has been in partnership with UM since December 2007, with the first students arriving in
September 2008. From inception to December 2015, 1,720 students have successfully completed the
ICM program with a minimum 2.0 GPA. Of these students, there were 1,610 that subsequently
registered at the U of M in a degree-seeking program, by Winter 2016.
This report outlines the contractual relationship between ICM and UM. It describes the quality control
measures that ensure that course content, instructor qualifications, all course work including final
examinations and the overall approval process for assessing student performance and outcomes meet
the academic standards for the same courses offered by UM. The report also describes professional
development opportunities provided to instructors at ICM and includes their feedback on teaching
experiences at the College. It outlines the support and programming available to students to facilitate
their adaptation to the Canadian cultural and academic context. Data on ICM student enrolment,
academic attainment, and satisfaction with the program are reported. The performance of ICM students
after transfer to the UM is compared with that of international students who were admitted under
direct entry to UM programs.
Overall, this report demonstrates that the viability of ICM programs, faculty support, and student
achievement are high. Student numbers have grown significantly since its inception in 2007, and ICM
transfer students’ academic performance in UM programs has compared favorably with direct entry
international students. Students and faculty report high levels of satisfaction with the teaching and
learning support provided by ICM. Student satisfaction with extracurricular support is high. While these
indicators of quality are gratifying, like all things they can be improved upon. ICM continually assesses
the program together with UM to ensure that high standards are maintained while seeking further
opportunities for innovation and improvement.

1. Introduction and Background
a. Rationale for the Relationship
In the Spring of 2007, UM began formal negotiations with Navitas that resulted in the signing of a
contract in December of that year. At that time, one of the UM’s strategic goals was to increase
international student numbers to comprise at least 10 per cent of its undergraduate population.
UM’s Academic Strategic Plans have always placed special emphasis on student success. In 2007, the
Provost, Robert Kerr, reported that “35-40% of international students are unsuccessful at the end of
their first year. For those international students who are not required to participate in English language
training at the University prior to admission (those admitted on the basis of their English Language Test
Scores) the failure rate is 52%” 1.
The University felt that it was critical to provide a less difficult transition to university study for
international undergraduate students. The International College of Manitoba (ICM) was seen as one
way to accomplish this.
Moreover, the establishment of ICM was expected to strengthen UM’s efforts to internationalize the
institution and to diversify the international undergraduate student body.

b. Summary of Academic Framework
In 2007, UM entered into an agreement with Navitas Canada Holdings Limited, a company incorporated
under the laws of British Columbia and registered in the Province of Manitoba. Navitas Canada Holdings
Limited is wholly owned by IBT (Canada) Pty Ltd, a 100% subsidiary of Navitas Limited of Australia,
formerly known as IBT Education Limited. In Manitoba, the company operates as the International
College of Manitoba (ICM). On October 20, 2011, Navitas Canada Holdings Limited was changed to
International College of Manitoba Limited.
ICM recruits and offers a range of academic and other supports to international students who, because
of English language proficiency and/or academic standing, would not ordinarily be eligible for direct
admission to UM. UM provides services and facilities in support of ICM’s teaching and learning role, for
which ICM pays a royalty. UM also provides academic oversight of the university-level courses offered
by ICM. The objective of the agreement between UM and ICM is to increase the quality, quantity,
preparedness, success, and diversity of international students attending the UM.

c. Programs Offered by ICM
ICM offers the following two programs:


1

The Foundation Studies Program, also referred to as University Transfer Program Stage I (UTP
I): This is a pre-university program designed to help students meet UTP II entry requirements
(i.e. course pre-requisites). Completion of this program does not entitle students to any credit
toward a degree at UM. UTP I courses may be viewed as equivalent to Grade 12 courses only for

Minutes of the Senate Meeting held on January 9, 2008, pg. 4.

417



the purposes of progressing to UTP II programs. Approximately 10 percent of ICM students are
registered in the UTP I program in any given term.
The University Transfer Program Stage II (UTP II): This program consists of university-level
courses based on UM curriculum, taught and moderated by UM-approved instructors, and
assessed by UM academic units as equivalent to their first-year courses. The UTP II program is
designed to prepare students for success in UM degree programs. Upon successful completion
of 30 credit hours of UTP II courses with a minimum grade point average of 2.00, students are
eligible to apply for transfer to UM. These courses are fully transferrable to undergraduate
degree programs at UM; many other universities in Canada also accept these courses for
transfer credit.

Students are admitted to UTP II only if they have completed appropriate course work at the secondary
level equivalent to Manitoba Grade 12 with an entrance score marginally below that set for direct entry
to UM, but which is mutually agreed to between ICM and UM’s Admission Office.

d. Academic Advisory Council
The International College of Manitoba and University of Manitoba Academic Advisory Council (AAC)
advises UM and ICM regarding the UTP II program and manages the academic relationship between the
two partners. The membership of this Council comprises equal numbers appointed by UM and by ICM,
plus a council Chair appointed by UM.
The AAC is a key point of liaison between ICM and UM and has four main functions:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Provide advice to ICM and UM on the academic operations of ICM.
Review the activities of ICM.
Monitor student achievement.
Report annually to Senate via UM President.

The role of this Council is reviewed in Section 5 below. The complete Terms of Reference for the Council
can be found in Appendix 1.

e. Academic Responsibilities
University of Manitoba
Instructors of UTP II courses must be approved in advance by the relevant Deans of Faculties or Heads of
academic departments of UM.
To ensure that each UTP II course meets UM’s academic standards and therefore qualifies for transfer
credit to UM programs, the UM Dean of the relevant Faculty is responsible for appointing a Course
Coordinator who, in turn, is responsible for:



ensuring the instructor is qualified to teach the course according to the standards of the UM
department;
reviewing the UTP II course outline, including the proposed assessment components, to ensure
they meet departmental standards;

418





providing occasional advice regarding course content and assessment standards to the UTP II
instructor;
ensuring equivalency of assessment standards by reviewing a sample of assignments and/or
final examinations; and
reviewing the final course grades to ensure these are consistent with UM norms.

International College of Manitoba
ICM operates in ways consistent with UM’s normal teaching and learning practices. In particular, ICM:











ensures that students have access to supplementary non-credit courses, and, if required,
ensures that students satisfactorily complete such courses;
ensures that students enrolled in UTP II courses have met the required prerequisite(s);
ensures that each UTP II course has no fewer contact hours than the University’s equivalent
course;
engages sufficient numbers of instructional staff to offer the UTP II program, and ensures that
all instructional staff meet the threshold requirements for appointment to a similar UM
position;
ensures that students are evaluated in UTP II courses using similar assessment methods and
meet levels of achievement that are consistent with those required by UM in its equivalent
courses;
provides a fair grade appeal process to students in UTP II courses—see Appendix 9, ICM
Academic Handbook, section 5.5;
charges students in UTP II courses tuition fees that are comparable to those charged to
international students in equivalent courses offered by UM; and
is responsible for the conduct of ICM staff and students on campus.

f. Admission to the University and Transfer Credits
ICM students who successfully complete 30 credit hours of UTP II courses are eligible to apply for
admission to undergraduate degree programs offered by UM, subject to:




meeting all admissions requirements including those for specific university-level courses;
meeting the minimum GPA required for admission to the relevant program; and
understanding that UM cannot guarantee admission of ICM graduates as admission to UM is
competitive and may be subject to quota (usually Faculty-specific).

If an ICM student is admitted to UM, transfer credits are awarded for completed UTP II courses, all of
which have been evaluated by the relevant academic department as equivalent to corresponding UM
courses. In cases where ICM students are not admitted to a particular Faculty (such as Engineering)
because of limits on the number of international students, ICM works with the Faculty and the student
to explore options at other Canadian universities.

419

g. Rules for the Operation of UTP II Courses
UTP II courses follow UM’s policies and practices with respect to prerequisites, co-requisites,
progression, and exemptions. ICM monitors changes in UM policies and practices and calendar
requirements.

h. University Services and Facilities
ICM students are provided access to UM services such as libraries and counseling services that are
available to UM students. Access is provided at fees similar to those paid by UM students.
ICM classes are held in various UM buildings in accordance with UM’s classroom booking system. ICM
uses UM laboratories for its Science course offerings. Oversight of the use of these laboratories is
provided by University personnel.
UM’s Admissions Office works closely with ICM staff to ensure a smooth transition of suitably qualified
ICM students to UM programs. At least once per term, a recruitment officer or admissions officer
advises ICM students on the University’s undergraduate programs. Advisors from various faculties also
meet with ICM students as they consider which UM programs to join after completing their studies at
ICM.
As part of the agreement, UM currently provides nine offices in University Centre for the administration
of ICM.

i. Quality Assurance
ICM strives to ensure that the quality of the student experience at ICM is high. Accordingly, a number of
quality assurance programs have been implemented to assist in assessing and increasing, where
necessary, the quality of programming, instruction, and student experience. Subsequent sections of this
report indicate steps taken by ICM to assure that ICM courses and processes meet UM’s high standards
of quality—Section 5 below outlines some of these quality assurance practices.

2. The Learning Environment at ICM
ICM programs provide a bridge between secondary school and university studies, primarily for
international students who do not meet the admission standards for direct entry to UM. ICM offers
students the opportunity to complete university-level courses based exclusively on UM’s curriculum.

a. Student Diversity
ICM is characterized by a wide range of diversity within its student body. Students are distinguished not
only by their national and cultural origins but also by significant variability of their:






first language;
approach to learning;
academic expectations;
prior academic attainment; and
motivation.

This diversity provides a rich and rewarding learning and teaching environment for students and
instructors. It also generates challenges that students and instructors must overcome if students are to
be successful.
ICM admission requirements are slightly lower than UM for English language proficiency and for high
school grades. This means that the risk associated with taking students who are below the minimum UM
admissions requirement is assumed by ICM. ICM students who transfer to UM must demonstrate their
eligibility to enter UM which ensures that UM gets students who have the demonstrated an ability to
succeed. ICM students are still required to meet the minimum entrance requirements to any UM
program as approved by Senate, prior to transferring to the institution. 2

b. Distinctive Teaching and Learning Environment
ICM addresses the challenges that international students may encounter through a holistic, studentcentred approach to their teaching and learning experience, which starts at pre-departure and
continues through to their transition to the mainstream university program. Facilitating this process are
a variety of support programs and systems, which are outlined further in this document.
ICM’s teaching philosophy embodies the following values and principles:





respect for diversity;
adaptation to the learning needs of students;
emphasis on scholarly inquiry and lifelong learning; and
encouragement for students to become independent learners.

Access to UM facilities and participation in the UM student community provide ICM students with a
seamless transition to their future studies at the UM.
ICM also believes that a supportive learning environment extends beyond academic instruction and
embraces general student welfare, with programming provided to meet these needs. In this regard, ICM
2

421

surveys its students regularly and adapts its programs and services to meet the full range of needs
students express. Appendix 2 and 3 provide additional information on these surveys.

c. Academic Schedule
ICM’s academic year consists of three thirteen-week terms. This allows students to spread their studies
across a twelve month period and, because there are three intakes per year, allows students the
greatest flexibility in beginning and completing their studies at ICM.

d. Development of Generic Skills and Abilities
In all of its teaching, ICM aims to develop in students the following generic skills:













written and oral communication;
appreciation of primary and secondary research;
analysis and critical evaluation of evidence;
problem solving;
use of information technology;
academic integrity;
independent learning;
interpersonal communication;
team work;
class participation;
cultural awareness; and
time management.

The aim is not only to give students the required content in each course, but also to develop and
demonstrate scholarly skills appropriate to the Canadian post-secondary context.

e. Delivery Model
The strategies and structures employed by ICM include:










small class sizes, generally fewer than 35 students;
one additional contact hour per week with instructors in each course;
block teaching (most courses are offered in 2- or 4-hour blocks);
an adaptive teaching model that focuses on student needs as they arise such as making
additional tutorials available to students who are at risk;
a mandatory first term Interactive Learning Skills (ILS) course which develops skills in listening,
analytical and critical thinking, research, academic writing (including grammar and referencing),
individual and group work;
accessible individual learning assistance (instructor consultation and ICM academic advisors);
proactive intervention if early academic results indicate difficulties; and
attendance taking, with follow-up on irregular attendance.

422

f. ICM’s Welcoming Environment
ICM has cultivated a warm and welcoming open-door atmosphere where students can access academic
and general advice whenever it is needed. This is essential for students in an unfamiliar cultural and
learning environment.
Academic advisors try to balance friendly assistance with helping students become self-reliant in a postsecondary educational system. ICM has a four-person full-time Academic Advising team.

g. ICM Programs
(i) Admission to ICM
ICM admits students directly into the UTP II program whose English language proficiency is below that
required by UM for direct entry. Following admission and the successful completion of 30 credit hours of
university-level courses at ICM, ICM students are deemed by UM to have demonstrated English
language proficiency. Students whose proficiency is marginally below that required by ICM enrol in the
Academic English Success course in which they concurrently take additional language training and
suitable university-level courses (see Mixed Programs below).
In other cases, students that may not be directly admissible to UM (because they have not achieved
results in academic subjects deemed equivalent to Manitoba grade 12 courses, or if UM is unsure of
their qualifications) are also admitted to ICM. However, in all cases, actual admission to ICM is on the
basis of school performance standards agreed between ICM and UM.
ICM offers two programs, University Transfer Program Stage 1 (UTP I) and University Transfer Program
Stage II (UTP II). The program framework is set out in Figure 1 below.

(ii) University Transfer Program Stage I (UTP I)
The UTP I curriculum has been developed for ICM, in conjunction with UTP II instructors, to ensure that
students achieve the preparation needed for successful transition to their University studies. The
program focusses on academic reading and writing, critical thinking, mathematics, chemistry and physics
that serve as prerequisites for admission to corresponding courses in the University Transfer Program
Stage II (UTP II).
Students complete the program by passing eight courses, each consisting of four hours of class time per
week, per term—a total of 52 hours of study per course. Students must meet minimum academic
performance criteria, which vary depending on the student’s anticipated study stream in UTP II. For
example, entry to the UTP II Engineering pathway program requires a 75 percent average in Physics,
Chemistry, and Math, and no grade less than 70 percent; entry to Business pathway program requires a
65 percent average; entry for Arts or Science pathway programs, requires a 60 percent average. A
student that passes four UTP I courses in one term with a minimum grade of 70 percent in each subject
may advance immediately to UTP II.
Students in the UTP II program who are lacking required high school prerequisites in mathematics,
chemistry, or physics may register in the appropriate UTP I courses.

423

Complete UTP I course descriptions can be found in Appendix 4.

424

(iii) University Transfer Program Stage II (UTP II)
The UTP II pathway programs consist of courses, the successful completion of which, facilitates transfers
to undergraduate programs in Arts, Business, Engineering, Environment, Earth and Resources, and
Science at UM. Appendix 5, Table A lists all of the UTP II UM courses offered by ICM since 2008. In
recent years, ICM has offered approximately 30-35 different UTP II courses per term. Not all courses are
taught each term, but care is taken to rotate course offerings so that students have access to a wide
variety of subjects during their studies at ICM. Many courses are delivered in multiple sections,
consistent with UM policy, which allows ICM to keep class sizes small. In the winter term of 2015, for
example, UTP II offered 33 courses in 97 sections, as shown in Appendix 5, Table B.
Complete course descriptions for the UTP II courses can be found in Appendix 6.

(iv) Mixed Program
ICM admits students directly to its UTP I and UTP II programs with an IELTS score of 5.5 and above with
no band less than 5.0 (or equivalent). However, UTP I and UTP II students who have an IELTS score of
5.0, and no band lower than 4.5, are admitted to ICM’s “Mixed” program. These students register in an
Academic English Studies (AES) course which meets for 16 hours per week. ICM’s Academic English
Studies course is taught by ICM instructors using a curriculum devised and overseen by UM’s English
Language Centre. These students also register in one or two academic courses, normally math or basic
science courses that do not require extensive reading or writing. The Mixed program allows students to
focus on the acquisition of English and to utilize their language studies in actual classroom situations.
This approach reinforces interest in learning English and allows students to make progress in their
academic studies at the same time. See Appendix 7 for the AES course outline.

(v) Ancillary Courses
ICM offers a course to all UTP II students referred to as Interactive Learning Skills (ILS). This is a required,
non-credit pass/fail course for which students are charged no fee. This course, provided over 13 weeks
in the student’s first term of study, addresses the learning skills required to be successful in university
studies in a Canadian teaching and learning environment. These skills include preparing for tests, note
taking, time management, writing research papers, and understanding and avoiding academic
dishonesty. The course also includes information to assist students’ adaptation to the Canadian context
such as history of Winnipeg, field trips around the city, colloquial English, and cultural differences
students may encounter in Canada.
Students on academic probation (Appendix 9, ICM Academic Handbook, Section 5.6) or students at risk
are required to enrol in a free seminar series entitled REBOOT. This series consists of eight workshops
that help students understand the significance of their academic record, their personal learning styles,
effective learning strategies for different types of courses, and personal action plans for their current
terms. Students are required to meet individually with academic advisors to assess their plans.
During the May 2015 term, ICM introduced a mandatory workshop for students who had been identified
as submitting plagiarised materials during the previous term. The objective of this workshop is to instill
in students an appreciation of what constitutes academic plagiarism and to help students devise specific
strategies to guard against such academic dishonesty in future.

425

Complete course descriptions for the ancillary course offerings can be found in Appendix 8.

h. Other Student Activities
ICM provides a number of support activities each term. These include the following:
PRE-DEPARTURE SERVICES – Prior to the start of each term, ICM provides detailed pre-departure
services to new incoming students. This includes numerous personal e-mail communications on
accommodations booking, registering for classes, and how to be prepared for coming to Winnipeg.
Additionally, ICM hosts pre-departure webinars for students prior to each intake, explaining what to
bring with them, what to expect when arriving in Winnipeg, banking information, last-minute
accommodations, and getting around campus. Students have the opportunity to ask questions and
acquire information on any outstanding issue. These webinars serve as a forum for students to meet
each other prior to arriving so they do not feel alone during the orientation session upon arrival in
Winnipeg.
Navitas maintains an offshore network of 23 offices with more than 130 staff that have responsibility for
more than 100 source countries. These staff are engaged in supporting students and their parents
during preparation for the students’ travel and study at ICM.
ORIENTATION - A compulsory Orientation Day provides a series of creative and enjoyable activities that
orient students to ICM, the overall operation of UM, and to Winnipeg. The Orientation Day is facilitated
by trained student volunteers who spend an entire term planning the activities and events. An
Orientation “Campus Tour” familiarizes student with important locations on the UM campus. An
“Academic Success” session familiarizes students with important information about their studies at ICM
including an introduction to the Student Academic Handbook which can be found in Appendix 9. This is
followed by an interactive session that quizzes students on what they have learned, with prizes
awarded. Finally, a major goal of Orientation Day is to allow students to meet new people and to have
some fun.
PEER ADVISORS – ICM’s Peer Advisors are students trained to advise other students. They provide help
and advice to students with questions about their studies and general inquiries. All Peer Advisors
participate in a series of training sessions and working group activities designed to prepare them for
their role. This program provides an excellent opportunity for students to get involved with helping
others. Peer Advisors are a great resource for students, in addition to ICM’s formal student advisors.
PEER EDUCATORS – The Peer Education Program involves two groups of students who have done
exceptionally well academically and wish to assist others with their studies. The first of these groups are
the Peer Tutors. After a period of training, Peer Tutors are available twice per week, on a drop-in basis,
to students seeking help with assignments for particular courses. The second group are the
Supplementary Instruction (SI) Leaders. These high achieving students are nominated by their former
instructors to lead supplementary group sessions to review core course concepts and facilitate
additional practice exercises for students.

426

ACADEMIC WORKSHOPS - ICM offers a number of workshops each term that are designed to help
students improve their academic skills. These include study strategies, reading and writing, and exam
preparation. Workshops are also held on ‘how to apply’ to different UM Faculties.
ICM STUDENT COUNCIL - The Student Council is comprised of a Student Leader, an Incoming Student
Leader, and twenty general members. The Council’s main purpose is to serve as an advocate for its
members with respect to the physical environment within which ICM operates, and to provide support
to students through social events and other awareness activities. Students are encouraged to join the
Student Council for a two-term commitment.
SOCIAL EVENTS - ICM hosts three student-led social events each term. Many different types of events
are offered, and have previously included soccer and cricket games, a Halloween ghost walk field trip,
skating at the Forks, winter outdoor activities at the Fort Whyte Centre, international pot luck dinners,
movie nights, glow bowling, paint ball, and cultural nights featuring music and dance performances by
students. These events are very well supported by the student body.
COURSE AND PROGRAM ADVISING - ICM has four staff available for academic advising who see
students on a drop-in basis. The ICM web-based student portal also contains a great deal of academic
information to help students make informed choices, and workshops are provided each term by ICM
academic advisors to help students plan their programs. Advisors from various UM Faculties provide up
to three information sessions annually depending on frequency of admissions to their programs.
VOLUNTEERING - Once students are settled in Winnipeg, ICM encourages them to get involved as
volunteers with activities at ICM, UM, or the greater Winnipeg community. Volunteer opportunities at
ICM include planning social events, tutoring academic subjects, assisting at Orientation, and helping with
other special events. ICM also engages its “alumni” (those who have transferred to UM) in volunteer
opportunities. These include lead roles in Orientation or Peer support program opportunities. Those
who express interest in these are provided specific training.
INTEGRATED TUTORIALS – ICM, with the support of the instructor’s feedback, embeds additional
tutorials within some of its courses that help students develop skills in essay-writing and problemsolving. Subject-specific tutorials in the past have included Literary Topics, Business Communications,
Thermal Sciences, and Statistics.
STUDENT PORTAL - Students and instructors have a user-friendly, web-based portal that provides
administrative support, communication, and course administration tools to enhance the students’
studies.
TRANSITION WORKSHOPS - University staff from UM’s Enrolment Services and the International Center
provide a workshop each term to help students with their transition to UM. ICM students are introduced
to Aurora, the student registration system at UM, and are provided with information on the registration
process. Students are also given some guidelines about student advising facilities in the Registrar’s
Office, Faculties, and Departments to help make their transfer to mainstream UM programs as seamless
as possible.

427

i. Access to University of Manitoba Facilities
Each term, ICM students pay compulsory fees (established by the University) to UM, akin to those paid
by UM students. This provides ICM students with access to general student services and facilities
available to UM students. These include the International Centre, University Health Services, Recreation
Services, Career and Counseling Services, campus libraries, computer labs, residences, and the homestay
program. ICM students are issued an “UMnet” ID to access computer services. The overall objective is
that ICM students will benefit from access to UM facilities on the same basis as UM students.

j. Student Feedback
ICM makes available a variety of ways for students to provide feedback about their ICM experience. All
students are asked to complete a web version of the University of Manitoba Students' Evaluation of
Educational Quality (SEEQ) for all courses. Students also evaluate their teaching and laboratory
assistants through a survey created by ICM and administered through the student portal. If students
identify instructional issues, ICM discusses them individually with the instructor until they are resolved
satisfactorily.
A Student Satisfaction Survey is completed annually (Appendix 2). In 2016, 14% of students completed
the survey. A summary of the key measures is provided in Tables 1, 2(a) and 2(b).

In recent years, the participation rate in the survey, as seen in Table 2a, has been disappointing. ICM has
attempted to encourage participation by offering incentives to participate and by considering when best
to schedule the survey, including the possibility of asking students to complete this during class time.
These efforts proved useful in 2015; however, participation rates dipped again in 2016. In future years,
ICM will work with the ICM Student Council to help promote the value of student feedback through the
completion of this survey.
Navitas participates in the International Graduate Insight Group independent research survey known as
the ”i-graduate survey”. This provides comparative data from the International Student Barometer (ISB)
from over 1200 educational institutions internationally and over 1.3 million student respondents.
Colleges and universities are compared with one another, and are provided trend analyses of their own

429

performance over time. In Canada, universities such as British Columbia, Toronto, Queens, Simon Fraser,
York, and Ryerson purchase this service. The survey captures feedback from students about their
experiences in terms of pre-arrival information, learning environments, living environments, and
supports available. ICM participates in the survey every two years. The ISB data provides ICM with
comparative data on key elements of student experiences as compared to other post-secondary
institutions, other Navitas colleges, and at ICM over time.
The results of the 2013 i-Graduate survey 3 are located in Appendix 3. At ICM, 341 of 751 students (45%)
of possible respondents participated.
Table 3 shows that ICM’s overall scores in each of the four main categories (learning, living, support, and
arrival) and indicates areas needing improvement.

In addition, the survey looks at sub-categories of data and Table 4 shows that the ICM scores in this
regard are comparable with both the ISB and other Navitas Colleges. It also identifies areas where ICM
students would appreciate additional services, such as career advice and work experience.
Using both internal and independently conducted external research, ICM is regularly monitoring the
satisfaction of its students. It uses these data to continually adjust and improve its student service.

k. ICM Response to Student Feedback
ICM reviews the feedback received from all student surveys and gives special attention to those items
for which satisfaction levels are below 90%, and those categories where there is a relatively low
proportion of “good” and “excellent” ratings.
Course specific feedback, in the form of SEEQ evaluations for every course, provides useful information
on the quality of instruction. ICM’s Senior Academic Manager meets with the individual instructors to
discuss these results, provides suggestions or strategies for dealing with reported problems, and helps
instructors develop a follow-up plan.
Student concerns about the physical classroom environment are communicated to UM in an effort to
find solutions.
ICM promoted and supported the formation of a student advisory committee in 2009-2010, which
subsequently resulted in the establishment of the ICM Student Council. Since that time, the Student
Council has taken a strong leadership role in two ways. On the one hand, the Student Council serves as
an effective advocate for its members with respect to the physical environment within which ICM
operates. At the same time, the Student Council is active in the organization of social events at ICM and
the encouragement of ICM students to participate in volunteer activities both in ICM and in the broader
community. These activities in turn have helped ICM “grads” to achieve leadership positions in UM
Faculty-based student organizations, in the UM Senate, and as elected officials in the University of
Manitoba Student Union.

432

3. ICM Students
a. International Mobility and ICM Student Profile
Globally, hundreds of thousands of students engage in studies outside of their home country. The
motivations of these students are multifarious, but in large measure they, and their parents, seek
educational opportunities abroad due a few key factors (or combination thereof):








Access: The access to high-quality education in their home country is quite limited. Though most
countries can boast at least one high-quality post-secondary institution, the number of spots
available in such institutions is quite limited and alternative options are not reputable or
otherwise undesirable. Study in a university or college outside of the country is the only option
for those students who do not have the very highest academic grades.
Reputation: Many students are focused on opportunities for gainful employment and rely on
the credibility and rigour that are imparted by an international credential from a reputable
educational institution.
English: Many students understand that their career prospects rely on strong fluency with
English which, in turn, makes them a more attractive candidate for hire and provides a higher
degree of mobility and work options.
Opportunities: Some students look to study as the first step towards immigration. International
students that graduate from university are excellent candidates for immigration as they have a
recognized credential, a fluency in an official language, work experience (in many cases), strong
social networks, and an already well-developed understanding of the host country’s cultural
norms.

For these reasons, and more, international study is a goal for many students and their families from a
very early age. While some students come from affluent backgrounds, many families around the world
save for many years in order to afford their children the opportunity to study and succeed abroad.
Many universities actively seek out international students as they are often seen as one reputational
marker of an institution’s openness to, and engagement with, the world. International students provide
different perspectives in the classroom, add to the cultural mosaic, support transnational research, and
provide the university with a cadre of motivated talent that contribute to its diversity, learning, financial
health, and place in the world.
The University of Manitoba provides students a compelling option for accessible, high-quality education
that is internationally recognized and provided in an environment that is not merely tolerant, but safe,
welcoming, and supportive. In Canada and Manitoba, this is buttressed by numerous governmental
initiatives: robust public funding for education, health care coverage, ability to work while studying, the
encouragement to work and immigrate after graduation, and a tuition tax rebate for those who choose
to stay.
While the above is a broad characterization of global drivers of international mobility, there are several
traits that characterize students that choose ICM.

433

They do not meet UM entrance requirements. Notwithstanding UM’s strong commitment to
accessibly and equity in educational delivery, ICM students are beyond the reach of the UM
because they cannot be admitted.
They are price sensitive. Fees at ICM are kept comparable to those charged by the UM.
Notwithstanding that these are significantly higher than domestic rates (for various reasons),
they are moderate in the Canadian context and – when comparing other English speaking
destinations – are relatively low. ICM – like UM – is attractive because of the offer a highquality of education at a reasonable price. This is particularly true when you factor in the
relatively low cost of living – accommodations, transportation, and food – in Winnipeg.
They are courageous, but realistic. ICM students are attuned to the challenges they will face
trying to succeed in a completely foreign environment – particularly if they’ve already
experienced academic struggles – and choose to take on the challenge all the same. They do
so, however, knowing that they need additional assistance and seek out options that provide
the additional academic and social wraparound supports provided the College.
Students marginalized by no study options at home, sensitive to costs, and willing to take a chance on
themselves - this particular combination of factors makes ICM students a unique cohort of students.
ICM students are very diverse in terms of nationality and culture, extremely dedicated and hardworking,
and highly motivated by the knowledge that ICM represents their best and, in many cases, only chance
to obtain a university degree.

b. Enrolment at ICM over time
In September 2008, the first intake of students at ICM was 33 students and enrolment has grown to
1,206 students as of the Winter 2016 term. Table 5 shows total student enrolment consisting of
returning students and new students, by term.
Students admitted to UTP I generally need two terms to complete their program before transferring to
the UTP II. Some students may need to complete additional courses in order to fulfill pre-requisites for
UTP II science courses. All of these circumstances would extend the time students spend in ICM.
Students in UTP II can complete the program in three terms, however, those in the Mixed program, who
need to complete an Academic English Skills program in conjunction with academic work, generally need
one additional term to complete their studies.

From inception to December 2015, 1720 students have successfully completed the ICM program with a
minimum of 30 credit hours and a GPA of 2.0 or greater. Of these students, there were 1610 (93.6%)
that subsequently registered at the U of M in a degree-seeking program, by Winter 2016. See Table 8 for
a breakdown of students by ICM program and completion date.
ICM has contributed to UM meeting and surpassing its international student target of 10% of total
undergraduate enrolment. By November 2015, international students comprised 16.2% of the overall
student population and ICM graduates made up 20% of the international student population at UM.

c. Country of Origin
ICM has admitted students from over 80 countries for the period through 2008/09 to 2015/16. Figure 2
presents the proportion of students from the countries with the largest representation at ICM. A
complete listing of students admitted to ICM, by academic year and country, can be found in Appendix
10. A few students in the list are shown as having Canadian citizenship, derived from their parents’
Canadian citizenship; however, their entire educational experience has been outside of Canada.

d. Retention of ICM Students
Table 6 presents attrition rates (eligible returning students who did not re-register at ICM), by academic
term. Students who chose to defer their studies for a single term are not included in this measure of
attrition.
At UM during the period 2010-2012, the latest three-year period for which data are available, the
average attrition rate between first year and second year for all undergraduate students was 13.6%,
with no difference between domestic and international students. At ICM during the comparable three
year period, the average attrition rate was 5.7%.

In addition to tracking student attrition, ICM attempts to gather information from students concerning
their reason for leaving the program, although not every student chooses to reveal this information.
Table 7 summarizes this information, provided by 620 exiting students since ICM began in 2008.

ICM collects anecdotal data regarding the transfer of students to other post-secondary institutions. As
noted above in Table 7, approximately 44% of students who withdrew from ICM moved to another postsecondary institution. Students have self-reported studying at a variety of universities across the
country, including Dalhousie University, University of New Brunswick, Concordia University, University of
Toronto, Carlton University, University of Ottawa, Ryerson University, Lakehead University, University of
Regina, University of Alberta, Thompson Rivers University, and University of Winnipeg. Some students
have also chosen to transfer from degree to diploma programs and have pursued options with Red River
College and Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology (formerly Winnipeg Technical College). Some
students have indicated they planned to study in their home country, the UK, Australia or the US.

e. Graduation Numbers and Rates
On average, ICM students complete the UTP II program in 3.5 terms of study. Those students who were
required to complete the UTP I program or the Mixed program before beginning their UTP II studies in
general require an additional one or two terms at ICM.
Table 8 details the number of students who successfully complete the UTP II program, by declared ICM
program of study (i.e. passed a minimum of 30 credit hours of UTPII courses with a minimum GPA of
2.0). Students can complete the ICM program in April, August, or December. Students who hope to be
admitted to Faculties that have September-only intakes (e.g., Asper School of Business or the Faculty of
Engineering) may apply and be admitted to the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Science, or the Division of
Extended Education until these applications can be considered. Some of these latter students choose to
stay an extra term at ICM.

(ii) Academic Performance at the University of Manitoba
The Office of Institutional Analysis provides data each year on the performance of ICM graduates (those
who have achieved a minimum of 30 credit hours with a GPA of 2.0 or greater) admitted to UM; these
has been included in the Annual Reports on the Operation of the ICM to Senate. These data compare
ICM student outcomes with both domestic and international student cohorts that have been admitted
on the basis of high school performance, following their second year of study. The domestic cohort
includes Canadians and permanent residents, and the international cohort includes students with
international status. A summary of the comparison of Degree GPA’s from 2009-10 to 2015-16 is

Historical data in this regard have been provided in the annual reports to Senate.
Effective July 1, 2015, the Faculty of Human Ecology's programs and departments joined other academic units
within the university. Students in Family Social Sciences are now reported under the College of Medicine.

presented in Table 10. This summary includes the academic performance of only those students who
moved directly from ICM into UM in following year, and only for the Fall and Winter terms.
In general, ICM students compare favourably with international students who are admitted directly to
the University of Manitoba.

g. Summary of Student Data
A critical indicator of ICM program quality is whether those that graduate succeed in their programs
once they transfer to the UM. Annual studies completed by the Office of Institutional Analysis (Tables
11a and 11b) show that ICM graduates that transition to UM are performing similarly and in some cases
better than, direct entry international students. A cohort would normally be assessed for graduation
after six years; however, as comparison solely on the basis of graduation does not address continuing
students, the categories of graduated and continuing students have been combined to provide a sense
of the outcomes of these two groups. The details of this summary are available in Appendix 11.

4. Teaching and Teaching Support
a. Who are ICM’s Instructors?
As noted previously, all UTP II instructors must be approved by the relevant UM Department or Faculty.
During the winter term of 2015, ICM had 45 instructors teaching UTP II courses. Of these, 26 (58%) held
a Ph.D. and six others (13%) were doctoral students. Many instructors have held previous appointments
as sessional instructors at UM or at other Manitoba post-secondary institutions.
During that same term, ICM had nine instructors offering courses in the UTP I program. These
instructors were chosen primarily for their teaching skills and are required to have university degrees
plus some high school or undergraduate teaching experience at the first year level.

b. How are ICM Instructors Appointed?
ICM instructors are appointed on a sessional basis each term.
UTP II instructors must be approved by the relevant UM Faculty. This is typically done by the relevant
Department Head or Associate Dean. Most instructors have been hired based on the recommendation
of a department from their roster of instructors. These may be faculty members, graduate students, or
sessional instructors. If a department has no recommendations to make, ICM recruits instructors and
secures approval prior to offering teaching appointments.

c. Instructor Training and Support
All instructors participate in an orientation session that provides information about ICM and its
approach to teaching. This session includes an overview of student demographics, approaches that have
been successful for classroom management, strategies for teaching in four-hour blocks, and general
policies. During the orientation, instructors receive training on the Student Portal and Moodle systems
which are proprietary software for the academic management of courses. They are encouraged to set
individual appointments with the ICM staff for assistance in the development of course materials and
websites.
ICM offers professional development (PD) opportunities to instructors. These PD sessions are presented
by experts from outside ICM. These are offered shortly after the conclusion of each term. Examples of
topics covered in the PD session are presented in Table 12 below. In addition, a debriefing session at the
end of each term allows instructors to share experiences, describe successful strategies, and to discuss
challenges they face in delivering their courses. These sessions have been very popular and have helped
best practices to emerge and be shared among instructors.
Instructors also have access to ICM’s “wiki” site to provide information and resources regarding
academic activities and logistics.
Collegiality among instructors and between instructors and ICM staff is also encouraged and supported
as much as possible. Instructors that teach courses within the same area of study will share and discuss
any issues they are facing in the classroom. Many ICM instructors also teach for the UM and are
included in meetings and activities within their respective Departments. Some UM Departments have
included ICM instructors in their meetings and professional development opportunities. As well, ICM has

444

struck an instructors committee to provide feedback and guidance on how academic collegiality and
professional development can be supported, encouraged, and improved on a continuous basis.

d. Facilities and Resources
ICM administrative offices are located on the fifth floor of University Centre. There is also a Student
Advising Office on the third floor of Fitzgerald Building. Three offices in St. Paul’s College are available to
instructors for student meetings and for drop-in office hours.
ICM classes are held in UM classrooms as assigned by the Registrar’s Office on the same basis as those
of other classroom assignments. It should be noted that several classrooms assigned to ICM are
provided on a block basis, providing for fully optimized use of those classrooms. In many instances,
classrooms assigned to ICM are in continuous use from 8:30 a.m. to 9:45 p.m., Monday to Friday, plus
some weekend classes.
The majority of teaching occurs in the Fitzgerald Building and St. Paul’s College, but a variety of other
buildings on the Ft. Garry campus of UM are also used for some classes. Larger classrooms are made
available for midterm tests and exams so that they can be conducted appropriately, and classroom
technology is provided by UM. ICM is assigned classrooms on full-day (8 am to 10 pm) or half-day (1:30
pm to 5:30 pm) scheduled. In 2014-15, nine full-day rooms and four half-day rooms were booked. In
2015-16, full-day rooms increased to ten.

445

Wet labs (chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, and geology) and computer labs are normally held in
UM Department facilities. Labs are scheduled around the availability of these resources. ICM covers all
variable costs associated with these laboratories including consumable materials, teaching assistants
and laboratory instructors as needed.
Students and instructors have access to the UM library system. They are issued an “UMnet” account to
access the computer labs and internet on campus.
ICM students may be housed in campus residences and may participate in the UM homestay program.
Suitable housing is always a matter of concern for students and their parents. ICM students have found
safe and comfortable housing in on-campus UM residences, housing in families organized through the
UM homestay program, and in private sector apartments and houses. Like the UM, ICM takes care to
ensure that students are aware of their rights and responsibilities as tenants and the mechanisms
available to them if they have concerns about their living arrangements.

e. Instructor Feedback
Instructors are provided feedback each term by means of Students' Evaluation of Educational Quality
(SEEQ) surveys. These are reviewed by the ICM Senior Academic Manager, who normally discusses the
results with instructors. SEEQ results are also made available to Course Coordinators.
Instructors complete a survey each term to provide feedback to ICM regarding the programs, policies,
and administration. Key indicators from these surveys are shown in Table 13.
Instructors submit brief reports at the end of each term providing suggestions for adaptations for future
classes, comments on student background that may be helpful for course development, additional
supports that ICM can put in place to help students, and any other topics they wish to share.

Questions/Statements

Instructors are also asked to give open-ended feedback at the conclusion of each term, providing
observations and/or analysis on each section of each course they have delivered, including areas of
success and where there could be improvement. These comments are synthesized and provided to the
Academic Advisory Council as part of each end-of-term report; they are then, in turn, provided to
respective Faculties and Departments for review, as appropriate.
In addition to feedback provided by instructors to ICM, the Vice-Provost (Integrated Planning and
Academic Programs) conducted surveys (in 2012 and 2015) among ICM instructors on their experiences
in teaching for the College. The surveys also asked Course Coordinators about work load demands in
working with the College. Information from the surveys is available in Appendix 12.

447

5. Mechanisms for Quality Assurance
a. the Academic Advisory Council
The Academic Advisory Council (AAC) is responsible for providing advice to UM and ICM regarding the
operations of ICM program. The Chair of the Council is appointed by UM and is currently the ViceProvost (Integrated Planning and Academic Programs). Formally, three members are appointed by the
University (although four normally attend Council meetings) and three members are appointed by ICM.
UM members have tended to be drawn from the Deans of Faculties to which ICM offers pathways. Since
its inception, one of the University appointments has been the Chair of the Senate Planning and
Priorities Committee (SPPC).
As of September 2016, the AAC membership is as follows:





Mr. Darcy Rollins, College Director and Principal, ICM; and

The Council’s Terms of Reference are found in Appendix 1.
The Council meets following each term to review ICM’s activities, based on a report from ICM detailing
enrolment, students’ country of origin, programs of study, grade distributions in all courses, student
retention, and graduation rates from the UTP II program. These reports also provide comments from
instructors and students on current courses and potential future course offerings.
In the autumn of each year, the Council prepares a report to the UM President describing and analyzing
ICM’s operations and activities during the three terms ending with the summer term. As a matter of
course, these annual reports are forwarded by the UM President to the UM Senate for information and
discussion. Appendix 13 provides information on where to access the annual reports.

b. UM Oversight for Quality Assurance
Departments or Faculties provide oversight and liaise with ICM to ensure that UTP II courses conform to
UM academic standards. They also ensure that instructors are properly qualified and that assessment
procedures are appropriate.
The process for ensuring course quality is as follows:




Deans or Department Heads appoint Course Coordinators for each UTP II course delivered by
ICM. Often, the Course Coordinators are the same individuals who coordinate these courses in
the relevant Departments.
Course Coordinators review instructor CV’s and may participate in instructor hiring interviews.
When multiple ICM instructors are teaching the same course, and where this is feasible and
consistent with Departmental practice, they will utilize identical course outlines and hold

common mid-terms and final exams. This provides consistency in course offerings and serves to
reduce workloads for Course Coordinators.
It is the responsibility of the Course Coordinator to maintain regular contact with ICM course
instructors and to provide advice and discussion of issues related to course content and delivery.
The Course Coordinator meets as required with the College Director and Principal and/or the
Senior Academic Manager at ICM to resolve any outstanding issues related to course delivery.
The Course Coordinator provides instructors with current course outlines for UM courses for
which ICM students seek transfer credit. These include details of assessment procedures and
required course texts. Outlines are then adapted by instructors for the ICM offering. The Course
Coordinator reviews and approves final outlines and assessment procedures prior to any course
commencement.
Course Coordinators are responsible for approving in advance all ICM assignments, tests, and
examinations to ensure conformity with UM standards. They may also review samples of written
assignments and completed tests.
On completion of reviews, the Course Coordinator reviews all marks given in the course and
approves all final grades in writing. The “Course Compliance Form”, as well as detailed
information on the course moderation process, is attached in Appendix 14.

In support of the fulfillment of the responsibilities of their Course Coordinators, Faculties receive
disbursements from the royalties paid by ICM each term, as outlined in Appendix 15.

6. Financial Contribution of ICM to UM
ICM financial contributions to UM are three-fold:
1. Royalties: Each term ICM pays royalties to UM in the form of a percentage of ICM revenues, as
specified in the formal partnership Agreement.
2. Fees: Each term ICM pays agreed fees to UM for ICM student access to UM a variety of student
services, including access to UM libraries and recreation facilities.
3. Tuition: ICM students that subsequently transfer to UM generate significant revenues through
tuition and the differential fees payable for the duration of their undergraduate degree studies
at UM. Since these are students who would not otherwise have been admitted to UM, these
follow-on fees are truly additional revenues for UM.

a. Contract Royalties
The royalties generated by the ICM contract are all over and above payments made to the English
Learning Centre (ELC), and for the professors teaching ICM courses, which are paid directly by ICM. Since
the inception of ICM, the annual contract royalty payments have continued to grow, with the 2016
annual payment reaching $4.1 million. As illustrated in Figure 4 and Table 14, contract royalties since the
inception of the ICM contract have accumulated to $14.4 million.

UM faculties are reimbursed from the royalty payments for delivering courses in the UTP II program.
Reimbursement is based on the schedule presented in Appendix 15, and has accumulated to $3.4 million
of the revenue transferred directly to faculties during the period of 2008-2016 (see Table 15).
$8.6 million in these royalties have supported capital projects such as the Learning Commons, upgrades
to St. Paul’s College, and renovations to the Fitzgerald Building.
As is the case for UM students, ICM students also pay a technology fee each term. To date this
accumulated to $876,913, which has been directed to the Technology Endowment Fund and, used for
the repayment of loans taken for larger projects, such as the campus WIFI project.
Figure 5 and Table 15 provide allocation details of ICM contract revenue during the contract period.

*Note that the allocation of royalties will not equal the total Contract Royalties due to the timing of

b. Expenses Associated with the ICM Program
As illustrated in Figure 5 (above) the ICM program is relatively cost neutral to UM, as ICM simply
requires teaching and office space.
Instructional space rental costs paid to both St. John’s and St. Paul’s colleges total just over $222,000
from 2008 to 2016. Other expenses include audiovisual equipment rental, as well as other minor
expenses totaled less than $35,000 over the period. Combined, these expenses represent roughly 1.8%
of the total revenue collected during the period.
Although overhead costs exist as part of the ICM program, these are mainly fixed expenses such as
amortization, principle and interest, electricity, and heating expense, which would exist without ICM.
Therefore, these expenses have not be included as part of this analysis.

c. Revenue Generated by post-ICM Students Registering for UM Courses
The registration of qualified students from the ICM program at the UM from 2008 – 2016 has resulted in
over $47.1 million in revenue. Figure 6 provides a detailed breakdown of revenue by fiscal year.

7. Summary
ICM makes every attempt to ensure a smooth transition of its students into UM undergraduate degree
programs. ICM provides extra supports to enable international students to be successful in an unfamiliar
educational environment. Over the past several years ICM students, the vast majority of whom did not
meet UM entry standards when they began study at ICM, have performed at least as well as
international students who had been directly admitted to UM. This is consistent with the expectations of
ICM when it was established in 2007.
The processes used to guarantee quality assurance addressed in this document have been followed and
are proving robust. UM Course Coordinators provide intensive academic oversight of ICM courses and of
ICM instructors and, as this report suggests, UM academic standards have been maintained consistently
at ICM.
The students from ICM bring significant benefits to UM academically, financially, socially and culturally.
They leave ICM academically well prepared. As UM students they have become involved in the student
life on campus, in part at least because during their time at ICM they grew to appreciate living and
studying in a Canadian university.

consumers, households and firms – make decisions. Macroeconomics encompasses the aggregate
economy and is concerned with issues such as the total output, interest rates, inflation and
unemployment. This course will attempt to combine economic theory with practical, everyday
applications. The goal of this course is to give students a sufficient understanding of economic issues
and problems so that students may understand the impact of government policy, economic phenomena
and the choices people make.

2.1 Programs at ICM
Program
University Transfer Program (UTP) Stage I
University Transfer Program (UTP) Stage II

Minimum Entry Requirement
Year 11 (or equivalent)
Year 12 (or equivalent) or UTP Stage I

A complete listing of Admission requirements is available at https://www.icmanitoba.ca/admissionrequirements.
2.1.1 UTP Stage I

ICM's University Transfer Program Stage I (UTP Stage I) bridges secondary school and undergraduate
studies. It consists of eight courses of study and is designed to prepare students for entry to universitylevel programs. UTP Stage I courses bear no credit hour value and will not transfer for credit to the
UofM, nor will they be included in the calculation of GPA.
2.1.2 UTP Stage II

The UTP Stage II program is equivalent to the first year of undergraduate studies and comprises courses
that will directly transfer for credit to the UofM. Programs offered with UTP Stage II include Arts;
Business; Engineering; Environment, Earth, & Resources; and Science.
2.1.3 Academic English Skills (AES) Mixed Program

For some ICM students, English may not be their first language. In recognition of the needs of such
students, ICM has a special program in place to help students address their English language needs.
Students who do not satisfy the English Language requirement must enrol in the Mixed English program,
comprising a course called AES100 – Academic English Skills, which consists of fifteen hours per week of
Academic English. In addition, they will take up to two academic courses in the first term of study. This
arrangement is beneficial in that it combines learning English for academic purposes with a gradual
introduction to academic courses.
Students who are concerned about their English and who have not been enrolled in the program are
encouraged to meet with the Student Success Manager to discuss the options available to them.

498

3. PROGRAM PROGRESSION
3.1 Progression from UTP Stage I to UTP Stage II
Upon successful completion of UTP Stage I students can advance to UTP Stage II. UTP Stage I graduates
must complete UTP Stage II prior to transferring to the UofM.
The UTP Stage I program is designed to prepare students for entry to university level programs.
Students are required to successfully complete eight courses during the UTP Stage I program with a
minimum standing as specified below. Under normal circumstances, no course may be repeated more
than once, but special permission for an additional course repeat may be approved by the Senior
Academic Manager.

3.1.1 Dual Curriculum Program

Students who have less than three UTP I courses remaining to complete UTP Stage I may enrol in up to
two UTP Stage II courses providing they are in good academic standing. UTP Stage I students who are
approved to enrol in UTP Stage II courses are restricted to taking a maximum of two UTP II courses per
term until they have successfully completed UTP Stage I.
3.1.2 70% JUMP Rule

Students who have completed 12 years of study in their home country may be eligible to ‘JUMP’ to UTP
Stage II if in a single term they successfully complete four UTP Stage I classes with a minimum grade of B
(70%) in each course. The determination of eligibility for exemption is made at the time of admission.
Additional assessment will be made on a case-by-case basis.
3.2 Progression from UTP Stage II to the University of Manitoba
A minimum of thirty unique credit hours with a minimum Best Ten GPA (see Section 4.1) of 2.00 or
higher must be successfully achieved in order to be complete ICM’s UTP Stage II program. It is
recommended that students complete their UofM Written English and Mathematics requirements while
at ICM.
Upon successful completion of UTP Stage II and having met the UofM specified Grade Point Average
(GPA) and pre-requisites, students are eligible to apply for admission to the UofM faculty programs.
Faculty application deadlines vary from term to term and students are recommended to refer to the

499

respective Faculty’s Admissions Bulletin for application deadlines and requirements. Workshops on how
to apply to the UofM will be held each term to assist students with the transfer process.
On completion of UTP Stage II, students will be issued a Certificate of Completion and an official
transcript, which will be forwarded directly to the UofM Undergraduate Admissions office for transfer to
the University.
3.3 Progression from Mixed Program to Direct Program
Upon successfully passing AES100 (Mixed program), students will no longer be required to complete
non-credit English classes and be eligible to take up to four academic courses per term.
3.4 Program Changes within ICM
Students are eligible to apply for transfer from one UTP Stage II program to another, providing they
meet the admission requirements for that program. To change programs, students are encouraged to
meet with a Student Advisor to ensure they meet the program pre-requisites and review course plans.

4. GENERAL ACADEMIC REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Grades and Grade Point Average Calculation
Final grades in ICM courses will be assigned a letter grade based on the UofM standards as described
below:

Satisfactory
Adequate
Marginal
Failure
Course not completed

The grade ‘D’ is acceptable as a passing grade, and the credit hours from the associated course will
contribute to attaining a Certificate of Completion from ICM. However, some UofM programs require a
minimum grade of ‘C’ or higher in courses used for admission purposes or as pre-requisites for higher
level courses. Students should consult an ICM advisor and relevant UofM advisors (Admissions or Faculty
advisors) to determine the need to repeat courses with a ‘D’ standing.
All final grades are subject to UofM Faculty/Department approval.
The grade point average is determined as demonstrated below. The definitions are consistent with
those used at the UofM as defined in the 2016/2017 Undergraduate Calendar.
Quality Points: The quality points for a course are the product of the credit hours for the course and the
grade point obtained by the student; e.g., 3 credit hours with a grade of ‘B’ (3.0 points) = 3 credit hours x
3.0 = 9.0 quality points.
Quality Point Total: The quality point total is the sum of quality points accumulated as students proceed
through their program of studies.
Grade Point Average (GPA): The grade point average (GPA) is the quality point total divided by the total
number of credit hours.
Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA): The CGPA is the grade point average of all courses. The CGPA
is calculated by dividing the quality point total by the total number of credit hours attempted. When a
student repeats a course or takes an equivalent course or mutually exclusive course (for example, a
course that may not be held for credit with the original course), all attempts at that course shall be used
in the calculation of the CGPA.
Best Ten Grade Point Average (Best Ten GPA): The Best Ten GPA is an ICM-specific grade point average
of the best thirty (30) unique credit hours completed at ICM. In cases where students have attempted a
course more than once, only the attempt in which the highest grade was achieved shall be counted
towards the student’s Best Ten GPA.

502

Credit Hours (ch): All UTP Stage II courses are assigned a credit hour value equivalent to the associated
UofM course. The majority of courses are delivered over one term and assigned a weight of 3 credit
hours, with the exception of Introduction to Psychology (PSYC1199 and PSYC1200) which is delivered
over two consecutive terms and assigned a weight of 6 credit hours. It is important to note that no
credit is given to a student who completes only the first term of a two term course.

ILS, AES, REBOOT, and UTP Stage I courses have no credit hour value and do not transfer to university
programs; grades from these courses are not included in university grade point average calculations.
4.2 Explanation of Codes/Notations
In addition to the letter grades listed in Section 4.1, the following grades may appear on a student’s
academic transcript.
CO: A student is continuing in the course.
DE: The letter grade DE is given when a physician’s certificate or other official documentation
substantiating a request for deferment on medical or compassionate grounds is received by ICM. See
Section 5.4.1 for more information.
N: The student was registered in the course, but did not write the final exam. Alternatively, the student
may have dropped the course beyond the Voluntary Withdrawal (VW) period. Students can officially
drop courses up to the published VW deadline with no academic penalty. An N is considered an F for
purposes of scholastic standing.
P: The grade of P has no numerical equivalent and does not affect either the term grade point average
or cumulative grade point average. The designation P will be given when a student successfully
completes a course graded on a pass (P) or fail (F) basis.
VW: Voluntary Withdrawal The notation VW is not a grade and does not affect either the term grade
point average or cumulative grade point average. The notation VW identifies a course freely dropped by
the student prior to the VW deadline of the term. No credit is granted for the course. Students are not
permitted to drop a course after they have earned a grade of ‘F’ in a course (i.e. for non-attendance or
academic misconduct). See Section 4.5 for more information.

503

AW: Authorized Withdrawal The notation AW is not a grade and does not affect either the term grade
point average or cumulative grade point average. The notation AW identifies a course dropped on
approved medical or compassionate grounds with supported documentation. See Section 4.9 for more
information.
4.3 Academic Integrity
ICM expects that students will approach their academic activities with honesty and integrity. Students
are responsible for ensuring they adhere to the principles of academic integrity and are ethical in their
behaviour in their academic work. Students are expected to ask for information and clarification if they
are unsure of their responsibilities as set up in the student handbook.
Academic misconduct means any conduct that has, or might reasonably be seen to have, an adverse
effect on the academic integrity of ICM and the UofM, including but not limited to:
a) Plagiarism – the presentation or use of information, ideas, sentences, findings, etc. as one’s own
without appropriate citation in a written assignment, test or final examination
b) Cheating on Quizzes, Tests or Final Examinations – the deceiving of fair testing procedures or
not following the exam regulations. Such acts may be premeditated/planned or may be
unintentional or opportunistic.
c) Inappropriate Collaboration – when a Student and any other person work together on
assignments, projects, tests, labs or other work unless authorized by the course instructor.
d) Duplicate Submission – cheating where a Student submits a paper/assignment/test in full or in
part, for more than one course without the permission of the course instructor.
e) Personation – writing an assignment, lab, test, or examination for another Student, or the
unauthorized use of another person’s signature or identification in order to impersonate
someone else. Personation may include both the personator and the person initiating the
personation.
f) Academic Fraud – falsification of data or official documents as well as the falsification of medical
or compassionate circumstances/documentation to gain accommodations to complete
assignments, tests or examinations
Students who engage in academic misconduct will be subject to discipline. All incidents of plagiarism,
cheating, inappropriate collaboration, duplicate submission, personation, or academic fraud will be
referred to the ICM academic unit. Students found in breach of academic conduct regulations related to
academic integrity will be subject to the following measures:




First Offence: Student will be awarded a ‘0’ mark for the assessment and given a permanent
record on their file
Second Offence: Student will be awarded ‘F’ for the course, regardless whether the second
offence was committed in the same or different course
Third Offence: Student will be expelled and be reported to Canada Board Services Agency.

Instructors may initially meet with the student to discuss the incident and to determine whether the
student requires additional training with respect to the behaviour. All incidents of academic misconduct
will be recorded in a ‘Letter of Allegation’ and provided to the academic unit for follow-up. A copy of
the ‘Letter of Allegation’ is to be given to the student and another kept in the student’s file.

504

The academic unit will contact students who have an allegation of academic dishonesty. Students will
have ten business days from which they are notified of the allegation to respond and book a meeting to
discuss the alleged incident. Students are given the opportunity to respond to the allegation and may
seek advice and representation from a student advocate/support person. The academic unit will also
determine the need for additional education regarding academic integrity and to review the
consequences of subsequent violations.
Students who believe they have been wrongly accused of academic misconduct have the opportunity to
appeal their decision by formally writing an appeal letter to the ICM Senior Academic Manager for
further review, to be submitted within ten business days from the initial meeting with the academic
unit. Students should provide substantial evidence that they were wrongly accused, supporting their
appeal letter.
4.4 Registration
Students select courses prior to the commencement of each term. Courses are offered based on
availability and sufficient demand from students. The College reserves the right to cancel or withdraw
courses at its discretion.
For further assistance with program planning and course registration, students are encouraged to refer
to the ICM Program Planning Guides and ICM Course Description documents located on Student Portal.
In addition, students are recommended to consult their desired Department’s Admissions Bulletin,
located on the UofM website, along with the UofM Course Calendar. For further assistance with
program planning, students may also wish to meet with a Student Advisor who can assist them with
using these key resources.
Registration is completed online through the Student Portal. It is available to returning students
approximately one week after the end of the exam period from the preceding term. Students prevented
from registering due to financial standing should consult the Finance Officer. Students prevented from
registering due to lack of a prerequisite or other academic condition should consult the Student
Advisors.
Students must pay for courses in advance of registration. Please arrange payment well in advance of the
registration date, to ensure payment is cleared. Once the registration deadline has passed, students will
not be eligible to register in classes, regardless of financial standing.
4.4.1 Course Load

UTP Stage I

UTP Stage II

Minimum Course Load
Three courses per term; however,
students are encouraged to register in
four in order to be eligible to qualify for
the JUMP rule (see Section 3.1.2)
Three courses per term; unless students
apply for Visiting Student Status (see
Section 4.7)

505

Maximum Course Load
Four courses per term

Four courses per term; unless students
apply and are approved for Course
Overload (see Section 4.6)

4.4.2 Repeated Courses

A student may be permitted to repeat a course or its equivalent. This applies to courses that were
completed with a satisfactory or failing grade, as well as courses from which a student has received a
VW. Effective Winter 2018, students will be restricted from enrolling in repeated courses during the
Limited Access Registration Period (see Section 4.5).
Students are normally permitted to repeat the same or equivalent course only once while at ICM.
Students who have failed a course twice will be restricted from re-enrolling in this course (referred to as
the ‘Repeat Rule’). Appeals may be sent to the Senior Academic Manager for review and are generally
only considered after a year has elapsed from the latest course attempt.
Students are encouraged to consult their desired Faculty/Department’s Admissions Bulletin and the
UofM Course Calendar for more information relating to their prospective future academic program and
the impact of repeated courses on the calculation of DGPA.
4.5 Adding and Dropping Courses
Limited Access Registration Period: (Commencing in Winter 2018) This initial registration period will be
available to all students who have paid their fees for the upcoming term. Students are prevented from
registering in courses they previously attempted regardless of letter grade achieved (including VW
grades). Students will only be eligible to register in courses they have not yet attempted. This
registration period will typically be limited to the first two business days of course enrolment.
Open Access Registration Period: (Commencing in Winter 2018) Following the Limited Access
Registration Period, students who are subject to ‘Limited Access’ can register for any course in which
they meet pre-requisites and who are not currently blocked from specific courses due to the ‘Repeat
Rule’ (see Section 4.4.2 Repeated Courses). This registration period will remain open until the start of
classes.
Registration Deadline: Students may change courses/class sections within one week of the
commencement of the term. In general, students are not permitted to add a course if more than one
teaching session has been missed. For this reason, it is encouraged that students register for courses
prior to the first day of classes.
Registration Revision Deadline: Following the end of Week 1, students will no longer be able to add
courses to their timetable but may drop a class prior to the end of the registration revision period
(typically end of Week 2), providing they maintain full-time status.
4.5.1 UTP I

Students in UTP I are not generally permitted to withdraw from any courses.
4.5.2 UTP II

Voluntary Withdrawal – No Financial Penalty Deadline: A student who is registered in four UTP II
courses or AES100 and two UTP II courses, and provide a written course withdrawal request to the
College prior to 5:00 PM of the last business day of Week 4 of the term (‘Voluntary Withdrawal – No
Financial Penalty’ deadline) shall receive a grade of ‘VW’ in that course and the fees for this course will
be reversed from the student account. Students who are registered in three UTP II courses or AES100
and one UTP II course are not permitted to withdraw from classes during this period, as to ensure fulltime status is maintained.

506

Voluntary Withdrawal – No Academic Penalty Deadline: A student who provides a written course
withdrawal request to the College prior to 5:00 p.m. on the VW deadline date published on the
Academic Schedule for that term (‘Voluntary Withdrawal – No Academic Penalty’ deadline) shall receive
a grade of ‘VW’. The withdrawal will appear on their transcript but will not affect their Grade Point
Average.
Requests Beyond VW Deadline: A student who withdraws from a course after the term VW deadline
shall be deemed not to have completed the course and will be given a grade of ‘N’ which has a value of
zero points in calculation of Grade Point Average (the same as an ‘F’).
In the event a student is unable to complete all the requirements of a course due to severe illness or to
other circumstances beyond the student’s control, the College may do one of the following:
a) approve the withdrawal without academic penalty (a grade of ‘AW’ will be assigned – see
Section 4.9 Authorized Withdrawal);
b) provide an opportunity for the student to complete specified requirements by a stipulated
deadline for the completion of the course. Note: Such an opportunity would not normally be
granted unless students can demonstrate that their term work and assessments are up to date,
and that they are passing the course.
Note: Students may not withdraw from a course in which they have already earned a grade of ‘F’ for
non-attendance or academic misconduct.
4.6 Course Overload
ICM Students are usually restricted to a maximum of four courses in each term. Requests to take five
courses will be considered based on previous term performance. Requests for course overloads can be
submitted to a Student Advisor by completing the Course Overload Form, which is located on Student
Portal.
To qualify for course overload, students must have maintained a minimum 80% attendance rate in all
courses the previous term, along with achieving a minimum academic requirement in their respective
program.
For UTP Stage II, students who achieved a grade of B or higher in all courses in the previous term will be
eligible for course overload, while for UTP Stage I, students who achieved a grade of A or higher in all
courses in the previous term will be eligible.
4.7 Visiting Student
In general, ICM students must complete their studies (minimum 30 and up to 60 credit hours) at ICM
prior to commencing any courses at the UofM. However, if a student is going into their last term at ICM
and the College does not offer any/enough courses that can be used either as a required or restricted
elective course in their planned degree program, the student may apply to be recommended as a
Visiting Student at the UofM through General Studies, Extended Education.
Courses completed as a Visiting Student do not contribute to the 30-credit hour completion
requirement at ICM. Requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis, but all students who wish to
apply as a Visiting Student to the UofM typically should:

507

EITHER
•
•
•
•

have a current Grade Point Average equal to or greater than 3.0
have completed 21 or more credit hours at ICM at the end of the current term
receive a Letter of Permission from ICM’s Senior Academic Manager or Student Success
Manager
complete a UofM General Studies Admissions application

OR
•
•
•
•

have a current Grade Point Average equal to or greater than 2.0
have completed 27 or more credit hours at ICM at the end of the current term
receive a Letter of Permission from ICM’s Senior Academic Manager or Student Success
Manager
complete a UofM General Studies Admissions application

Visiting Student Forms are available on the Student Portal.
4.8 Classroom Attendance
Written notice on any illness necessitating absence from ICM must be given as soon as possible.
Students who have suffered from an infectious illness will not be permitted to attend classes until a
medical certificate has been received by ICM stating that there is no danger of infection to others.
As an ICM student you are welcome to access the University Health Services located in 104a University
Centre. They have a variety of physicians, nurses and health care professionals dedicated to students.
Information on their services is available at http://www.umanitoba.ca/student/health/ or by calling 204474-8411.
If a student is absent from class for any reason, the student must complete an Explained Absence Form
(EAF). If the absence is due to illness, the student should attach a Medical Certificate to the form. If the
absence is not due to illness or if the student does not have documentation, the student must explain
under ‘Comments’ the reason for the absence and attempt to provide a letter of explanation from a
parent/guardian or relevant persons (or any related documents such as police reports, death
certificates, etc.).
Students may also contact the instructor or Student Advisor to see if there is another section of the
course (during the week in which class was missed). If approval is granted, the student should then
attend the repeat lesson. Students should then resume their studies by attending their regular schedule
of lectures, as listed on their Student Portal timetable.
Instructors will use their discretion when signing the EAF, approving the absence or not, on a case-bycase basis. It is the student’s responsibility to return the EAF and other documents to ICM Staff. If more
than one class is missed, a separate EAF will need to be completed for each missed class. The Senior
Academic Manager may reconsider an instructor’s approval if the reason is insufficient or if the student
has a history of poor attendance.
Attendance is an important element of a student’s success; therefore attendance at all classes is
compulsory. In the event that attendance is considered unsatisfactory, Formal Warnings (written notice)

508

may be issued to students by mail, Portal messages, phone and/or email. Any academic staff member
may interview students about their attendance. Students who miss more than maximum number of
absences listed in the Course Outline may be subject to an ‘N’ grade for the course. Every attempt will
be made to contact students concerning poor attendance. However, students should note that
attendance is ultimately their responsibility. For further information about the warning system in place
for poor attendance, students can speak a Student Advisor.
4.8.1 Classroom Management

Students should note that decisions concerning matters of both classroom management and
assessments ultimately lie with their instructors.
Students should respect their instructor’s decisions at all times. Students are encouraged to speak with
their instructors should they have concerns about their attendance, academic performance or class
participation in a particular course. Following this course of action, if there are still concerns, students
are encouraged to speak with the Student Advisor or Student Success Manager.
Use of English: Students are expected to speak in English in all classrooms at all times. This strengthens
English language skills, and demonstrates respect to class members and instructors.
Mobile Phones
Students must switch off their mobile phones before entering ICM classrooms. Also, text messaging and
web browsing are not permitted when in class, unless otherwise authorized by the instructor. Failure to
adhere to these rules could mean that your mobile phone is taken from you. Mobile phones must not
be taken into exam venues.
Dress and Fragrances
Students who choose to wear inappropriate clothing or excessive amounts of fragrances may be asked
to leave the classroom out of respect for others who are attending the class.
4.8.2 Within Term Assignments

A Medical Certificate (MC) or equivalent supporting documents will be required for a deadline extension
of any within-term assessment after the due date.
There will be a penalty to be determined by the instructor and consistent with the UofM department
practise. However, an exception may be granted when the student provides:
•
•

A MC and ‘Explained Absence Form’ (EAF). This will be reviewed and signed by the instructor for
approval; or
A written explanation (EAF) which is to be reviewed and signed by the instructor for approval, in
the case of personal circumstances that have the potential to significantly affect student
performance.

All written evidence must be submitted within two business days of the prescribed date of the
assessment task. It is the student’s responsibility to show the evidence to the instructor and hand it to
ICM Reception. In cases where the within-term assignment has significant weighting (equal to or over
25%), the instructor will discuss the matter with the Senior Academic Manager or Student Success
Manager.

509

4.9 Authorized Withdrawal
Students who have valid and documented reasons for withdrawal, such as medical illness or
compassionate circumstances, may be authorized to withdraw from courses without penalty. Requests
for Authorized Withdrawals (AW) must be submitted in writing to ICM by completing the ‘Authorized
Course Withdrawal Form’ as well as by providing supporting documentation, such as: funeral program
or obituary; police report or auto accident report; travel receipts; and/or letters or documents from
objective, credible and verifiable health care professions. Students are encouraged to consult the
‘Health Care Provider Statement for Authorized Course Withdrawal Form’ located on Student Portal.
Student Advisors and the Student Success Manager are available to provide information and assistance.
An AW may be approved under the following circumstances:
a) Medical grounds. When a serious event - including but not limited to illness, accident, or injury affects a student’s ability to attend classes and/or complete course requirements; and/or
b) Compassionate grounds. When an extraordinary personal circumstance, including but not
limited to a serious illness or death of a significant person in a student’s life affects a student’s
ability to attend classes and/or complete course requirements.
Requests for AW will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will typically only be considered for
withdrawal from all courses in a given term. Requests for AW will be considered for the currently
enrolled term and for terms dating back no more than three academic years.
The approval of an AW request will not automatically result in a tuition fee refund. Tuition appeals
dating back more than one academic year will not be considered.
4.10 Program Deferral
In some cases, students may wish to extend their time off between terms. Students may defer their
studies for one term, provided they have a minimum of one term of completed study at ICM. To apply
for program deferral, a ‘Program Deferral’ form must be submitted to the academic unit and a meeting
with the College staff member may be required. Program Deferral forms can be found on the ICM
Student Portal. Students may not defer their studies for more than one term.
Note: There is an administrative charge for deferring enrolment. Please consult the ICM office for
additional information.
4.11 Advanced Standing
ICM does not accept transfer credit. Students who have completed post-secondary studies elsewhere
may be eligible for advanced standing after they have successfully transferred to the UofM from ICM.
Final determination of transfer status for each course studied outside of ICM is subject to evaluation by
the UofM.
4.12 ICM Transcripts
A formal and complete ICM transcript will be provided to the UofM at the time of application and upon
completion of the program. At the end of each term, results for current students summarizing
performance in the most recent term will be posted to the ICM Student Portal. This report will provide
details of courses studied and results expressed as a letter grade and grade point average (GPA), where
applicable. Students may request Official Transcripts from the ICM Reception as needed.

510

5. ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESS

Students are assessed in each course according to the course instructor’s guidelines of assessment and
attendance. The College may disallow a student from continuing in a course if, in the opinion of the
College, the student’s progress and/or attendance in that course has been unsatisfactory. The student
concerned shall receive a grade based on the assessment up to that point.
Students will be issued detailed course outlines at the start of each term. These outlines provide
information regarding course content, assessment procedures, resource requirements and contact
information for the instructor of the course. Course outlines are also posted on the ICM Student Portal
under Student Resources, Documents. It is wise to retain all outlines for future reference.
5.1 Examinations
Examinations will be conducted at the end of each term under supervised conditions. Students should
carefully note the date and time of their exams. Students are expected to familiarize themselves with
the Examination Regulations, which must be strictly observed. Regulations are displayed on the ICM
Student Portal.
Examinations will not be rescheduled and there are no supplementary exams.
ICM requires detailed written evidence if a student misses an exam for medical reasons (a simple
Medical Certificate is not acceptable). See section 5.4.
5.2 Exam Cancellation Due to School Closure
In the event ICM must close due to inclement weather or other unforeseen circumstances, all
examinations scheduled that day will be rescheduled for a later date within the current exam period.
Students will be informed via the ICM Student Portal of the new day/time of the exam(s), which will be
scheduled between the hours of 9am and 9pm. Should the College be forced to close on the final days of
exams, ICM will reschedule those exams at a date to follow the prescribed examination period and/or
during the new term.
As the rescheduling of final examinations can affect a student's subsequent transfer to the UofM, every
effort will be made to reschedule the exam(s) within the current examination period.
5.3 Supplementary Examinations
ICM does not offer supplementary examinations at any level.
5.4 Deferred Tests or Examinations
Students who miss a test or examination because of exceptional circumstances may apply for a deferred
examination. Deferred tests and examinations are conducted at the discretion of the College and only
as a consequence of serious illness or extraordinary personal circumstances which have the potential to
impinge significantly on student performance. Applications for deferred tests and examinations must be
received with supporting documentation. ‘Exam Deferral Application Form’ forms are available on the
ICM Student Portal.
Deferred examination dates will be determined by the ICM academic unit. These exams typically occur
the day following the end of the official exam period. By exception, students needing special
accommodation may be granted permission to write within ten working days from the start of the
following College term.

511

To be eligible for a Deferred Examination, students must satisfy all of the following conditions:
•
•
•

the student must have satisfactory attendance (80%) in the scheduled classes for the course;
the student must have completed and passed the term assessment requirements specified in
the course outline; and
the extenuating circumstances must be significant and be supported by evidence.

5.4.1 Requests Prior to Examination Date

Students with known exam conflicts may request a deferred examination by completing the ‘Exam
Deferral Application Form’ and providing supporting documentation. Applications for a deferred
examination due to a conflict must be filed twenty working days prior to the date of the scheduled
exam. Travel plans are not an acceptable reason for missing an exam. Applications that are typically
considered include, but are not limited to, requests based on religious reasons or exam conflicts for
visiting students who have a UofM examination at the same time as one scheduled by ICM.
5.4.2 Requests After Examination Date

Students who have written the scheduled final exam are not eligible to apply for a deferred exam. By
entering the examination room, students are acknowledging that they are fit to write the assessment.
Students who are applying for a deferred examination due to an unforeseen circumstance should notify
their instructor and the ICM Student Advisor of their absence prior to the start of the final exam. An
official ‘Exam Deferral Application Form’ must then be submitted within two business days of the
examination. Supporting evidence, clearly stating specific reasons, must be submitted with the deferred
examination application.
Note: The following reasons are not acceptable grounds for applying for a deferred exam:
•
•
•
•
•

Requesting on the basis of undocumented medical reasons
Arriving late for the examination
Misreading the examination timetable
Missing the final exam due to delays with public transportation
Traveling during exam period

5.5 Grade/Course Appeals
If a student has good reason to believe a mistake has been made in the assessment of the original grade,
an appeal of the assigned grade may be made.
5.5.1 Course Work Grade Appeals

If the appeal process is being initiated during the academic term prior to the release of final grades,
students may approach the instructor directly if they believe there is a discrepancy in the marking of a
course assessment.
If dissatisfied with the instructor’s decision, the student should submit a formal letter of appeal to the
Senior Academic Manager for formal investigation, to be provided within ten business days from the
time the grade was released. The appeal must specifically state the identified assessment issue as it
relates to non-adherence to the stated assessment procedures and not simply express dissatisfaction
with grades.

512

5.5.2 Final Grade Appeals

Students may appeal a course grade within fifteen working days from the start of the term immediately
following the term in which the grade was awarded. Where the grade discrepancy is related to the final
examination grade, students will be given an opportunity to review their examination under the
supervision of the Academic Department. If students are unsatisfied with the grade they’ve received and
have identified a discrepancy that would lead to a higher letter grade, they may file a formal appeal
using the Appeal of Final Results Form, specifying the area of contention and provide this to the ICM
reception. Note: a fee applies for appeals – see Grade Appeal Fee section below for more information.
The Senior Academic Manager will arrange for a third party to review all components of the assessment
and make a recommendation. This recommendation will be final.
5.5.3 Grade Appeal Fee

Payment of $50.00 is required for each appeal submitted to the ICM office for term work, final exam,
and final course grade. A refund will be applied if the appeal is successful.
5.6 Satisfactory Academic Progress, Academic Probation and Academic Warning
ICM is required to monitor students for compliance with academic program requirements and provide
opportunities for students to overcome any difficulties they may have with their studies.
5.6.1 Academic Probation

Students who do not pass at least half their courses in a term may be assigned to academic probation in
the subsequent term. The progress of students on academic probation is closely monitored to ensure
they are successful in their future studies. Failure to comply with the conditions listed below may result
in the escalation of probation level or termination from the ICM program.
Students who have not previously been on academic probation will be assigned to Academic Probation 1
(AP1). Students who were previously on probation and who do not pass half or more of their classes
may have their probation level escalated (see table below).
Students who pass more than half of their course load will successfully be removed from academic
probation.
Note: Students who successfully satisfy academic probation conditions but who then do not pass half or
more of their course load in a future term may be placed back on academic probation at a higher level.

5.6.2 Academic Warning

Students with a CGPA below 2.0 will be placed on Academic Warning. Students will be notified of
Academic Warning if their CGPA puts them at risk of not being admissible to a faculty at the UofM.
Students who receive notification of Academic Warning should meet with a Student Advisor for advice.
5.6.3 Engineering Good Standing Policy

If a student does not obtain a grade of B or higher in at least two subjects each term, he or she shall be
‘Ineligible to Study in the UTP II Engineering Program’.
If a student accumulates more than 18 credit hours of ‘F’ or ‘D’ grades in UTP Stage II level courses, he
or she shall be ‘Ineligible to Study in the UTP II Engineering program’, as 18 credit hours is the maximum
number of F and D grades (and VWs), including repeats, allowed by the Faculty of Engineering in a
student’s first 72 credit hours attempted.
If a student becomes Ineligible to Proceed, their program of study will automatically be changed to UTP
II Science unless the student indicates another program choice using the ‘Online Form - Change of
Program’
If a student accumulates 6 credit hours of ‘F’ or ‘D’ grades, the student shall be warned about the policy
and threshold re: Ineligible to Proceed in the UTP II Engineering program.
5.6.4 Refusal of Enrolment

Where evidence of any criminal conviction, misconduct or incapacity on the part of a person/student
affects the safety or ability of staff/students to pursue their lawful activities within the College, ICM
may:
•
•
•

Refuse to enrol;
Refuse to re-enrol; or
Discontinue enrolment.

5.6.5 Cancellation of Enrolment

The College may cancel the enrolment of any student:

514

•

who has failed to fulfil the normal requirements for admission or enrolment, or
for any act of grave misconduct associated with the academic program of the College.

5.6.6 Termination of Program

Neglect of work, non-attendance, non-payment of tuition fees or misconduct may lead to a student
being terminated from his/her program of study.
5.7 Lab Exemptions
In select courses, a lab exemption may be permitted to students who have previously taken the course
and successfully passed the assessments of the associated lab tutorials. Lab exemption requests must
be submitted by email to register@icmanitoba.ca prior to the end of the first week of classes.
Unless otherwise specified by the respective course’s department, the following criteria must be
observed in order to qualify for a lab exemption:
•
•
•

CHEM1300 – Students must have achieved a minimum of 70 percent on the lab component
within the last two years.

Appendix 12: Instructor Feedback to Vice-Provost, 2013 and 2015
ICM Instructor Feedback Summary 2015
Prepared by David Collins
Chair AAC and Vice-Provost (Academic Planning & Programs)
On June 30, 2015 the Chair of the International College of Manitoba (ICM)/University of Manitoba (UM)
Academic Advisory Council (AAC) conducted an email survey of sixty individuals identified as instructors
contributing to a course (or courses) in the ICM program. A follow-up reminder was issued on July 23,
2015. The list of instructors was compiled by Richard Lobdell, the College Director of ICM, and included
all instructors contributing to the ICM program during the 2014/15 academic terms.
The instructors were informed that the AAC is charged with providing advice to both ICM and UM
regarding the operations of ICM (see Appendix 1) and were requested to share comments (positive,
negative, or advisory) about their experience as an instructor in the ICM program, in support of AAC’s
role. Feedback (including a nil-response) was requested by email, letter, or phone, and individual
meetings were offered at the discretion of the individual. Respondents were assured that individuals
would not be identified in reports arising from this process, and that anonymous material would not be
accepted.
In total, 26 of the 60 instructors surveyed responded to the survey for a response rate of 43 %—all
responses were by email, and no requests were received for individual meetings. Of note, 28% (17 of 60
instructors) responded to the same survey conducted in 2013.
The majority of instructors (24 or 92%) provided positive comments about their working conditions at
ICM, and a number provided other useful comments and suggestions:
•

‘Overall, I enjoy working at ICM. I enjoy my interaction with students and I receive a
great amount of support from ICM staff.’

•

‘For the most part, my experiences working for ICM have been very positive. The College
staff are very professional and accommodating and each semester the college puts
together Professional Development sessions for all instructors, which as a newer
instructor I find very useful.’

•

‘I am very happy to work for ICM. The staff are helpful and kind. Very well organized
institution.’

•

‘This was my first work experience with ICM. It was good experience. Staff are very
cooperative and helpful.’

•

‘I personally have no issues and it was a great semester.’

•

‘So far I do not any issues to raise, it was a joy to teach international students and
administrative staff have been supportive.’

•

‘I have thoroughly enjoyed teaching for CM these last three sessions. The extra hour or
so of lecture/class-time allows me more time for class discussions and working with
individual students. This is especially useful to recent ESL students or those struggling
with course content. I also receive a high level of support from ICM administrative staff.

528

Student advisors are especially helpful (not only to me, but my students as well) in
working with students and in providing additional supports to instructors. I believe ICM
to be an asset to the U of Manitoba; enabling students to acculturate to Canadian
society and a Western educational system, be preparing them academically to enter
degree programs. I have run across many former students who have successfully
completed their degree programs at the U of Manitoba, and express their appreciation
for the 1-2 years they spent at ICM. These students reflect very positively on their
experiences at ICM.’
•

‘No concerns. My time teaching has been wholly positive.’

•

‘I am very satisfied with the working conditions at ICM. I receive support from
administrative staff as needed, despite the recent loss of staff. I have no concerns to
report and look forward to working as an instructor with ICM long into the future.’

•

‘I find the working conditions with ICM to be satisfactory.’

•

‘Working conditions at ICM are the same as they are when I'm working at UM. Things
are good and when I have issues, they are quickly remedied by the administration at
ICM. I am a bit concerned with the frequent turnover of the academic manager.
However its impact on me is quite low.’

•

‘I have very positive experience with ICM. I enjoy teaching my course and working with
international students. The teaching assistants are dedicated and committed to their
responsibilities. The administration of the colleges is experiencing some changes in
senior staff members, but this hasn't affected my teaching experience. Thanks for
holding this survey which I think will improve ICM even more.’

•

‘I greatly enjoy working with the students at the international college. I find them to be
pleasant and very typical of most young adults that I know. They require encouragement
to engage and get work done, but they are always respectful and kind. Most of the time,
ICM has been respectful of my needs as a sessional instructor.’

•

‘I have been teaching ICM for about * years now. My experience in working with ICM has
been amazing. The staff at ICM are very friendly and helpful. I believe that ICM's
approach of having classes with 30 or so students, give us an opportunity to focus on
each student individually. Because all the students are from an international
background, it gives them a common platform to interact and socialize. The teaching
environment and facilities is the same as UM. I wish that UM have programs that focus
on international students too.’

•

‘I have no problems associated with being an instructor at ICM. I have found my
experiences working for the International College to be very positive. One of their
policies, which I have found to be very helpful in my teaching, is the fact that the student
advisors are very proactive with the students registered in ICM. They do a very good job
of contacting students who have missed classes, assignments, or who are not doing well
in the course. These students are invited to come in and discuss any issues they might be
having in their academic and personal lives. I think this level of support is necessary for
all students but especially for those who are studying away from home.’

Of two instructors that did not specifically forward positive comments about their experiences with ICM,
one expressed concerns about the coordination of class and laboratory schedules that caused some

529

frustration, and the other concerns about instructional space. The latter noted that ‘classrooms in the
Fitzgerald building are horrible. The heating and cooling does not work properly. For the winter and
summer sessions of 2015 the rooms have been too hot. After a short period of lecturing I am soaked in
perspiration. This is not a good learning environment for students.’
Concerns about classroom configurations and the lack of available space for personal consultation with
students were also raised by three other respondents; one noting ‘that ICM does not have enough space
on campus, which means a good number of instructors share offices, to that extent that they are difficult
spaces to utilize for meeting with students. The classroom spaces are functional, but almost all in older
buildings with poor seating and heating systems.’ Another suggested the need improve the overall
appearance of space allocated to the program in the Fitzgerald building.
Two instructors expressed frustration with the four hour lecture times adopted by ICM; in particular,
concerns about student fatigue and maintaining student interest over a four hour period. One suggested
that 2 hour time slots twice a week would be more practical for accommodating other teaching
schedules (for instructors teaching at both ICM and UM), to minimize fatigue in students, and to help to
acclimatize them to the class schedules they will have on moving to UM. However, another instructor
expressed a contrary view, noting that the extra hour or so of class time provided by the four-hour
timeslot ‘allowed more time for class discussions and working with individual students. This is especially
useful to recent ESL students or those struggling with course content.’
A number of instructors provided feedback about the ICM administration, in particular commenting
about changes arising with the sad and untimely passing of Susan Dean, the first College Director in
****. Some expressed concerns about changes; ‘Lately, it has been confusing due to the internal
changes at ICM, such as, for example, lack of someone replacing the academic manager or the interim
nature of the current director’, and ‘there has been a lot of turnover in the senior administrative ICM
staff this year. I would like to see more continuity here.’
However, others took a more positive position, noting the following:
•

‘Academic leadership at the college, though it has fluctuated significantly (because of
unfortunate circumstances), are very respectful of academic freedom for Instructors and
monitor classroom success and teaching practices with effective and frequent
communication with instructors. When I had some concerns about plagiarism at the
college the staff listened to my concerns and very quickly implemented workshops for
students to receive extra awareness about the importance of proper citation and
academic integrity.’

•

I am pleased with how well the ICM Administration is functioning considering the
substantial personnel changes they have had over the past year’, and

•

‘Administration of the college is experiencing some changes in senior staff members, but
this hasn't affected my teaching experience.’

Other comments/suggestions generated by the survey:
•

that ICM provide longer term contracts to make the instructors working at the College more
secure;

•

that ICM facilitate meetings between instructors and TAs at the beginning of each semester to
discuss approaches to improving student performance;

530

•

that ICM devote more time at the beginning of each semester to make sure students are aware
the rules and regulations, in particular addressing the inappropriate use of cell phones for
texting and browsing during lectures; and

•

that ICM evaluate the efficiency of the online attendance system.

Overall, consistent with the survey conducted in 2013, the majority of instructors responding to the
survey reported a positive interaction with the ICM program.

ICM Instructor Feedback Summary, 2013
Prepared by David Collins
Chair AAC and Vice-Provost (Academic Planning & Programs)
On February 21, 2012 the Chair of the ‘International College of Manitoba (ICM)/University of Manitoba
Academic Advisory Council’ (the AAC), surveyed by email a list of sixty individuals identified as
instructors contributing to a course (or courses) in the ICM program. The list was compiled by Susan
Deane, the College Director of ICM and included all instructors contributing to the ICM program since its
inception in September 2008 to the January 2012 term.
Respondents were informed that the AAC is charged with providing advice to both ICM and the
University regarding the operations of ICM—Appendix 1. Respondents were requested to share
comments (positive, negative, or advisory) about their experience as an instructor in the ICM program,
in support of AAC’s role.
Feedback (including a nil-response) was requested by email, letter, or phone, and individual meetings
were offered at the discretion of the individual. Respondents were assured that individuals would not
be identified in reports arising from this process, but that anonymous material would not be accepted.
Of the 60 individuals that were contacted, 15 responded in writing by email, 1 requested a telephone
interview and 1 an individual meeting with the Chair. In total seventeen individuals responded to the
survey, providing a 28 % response rate; a reminder email was sent on March 3, 2012.
All but one of those responding provided positive comments about the working conditions and support
provided by ICM—see following excerpts from these responses 6:

During my short time working with ICM, I had no issues or concerns about working
conditions.
I have overall a good working experience with ICM. From my experience, I would credit
the ICM with mentoring young and inexperienced international students adapting to
North American academic environment.”
I would like to express my satisfaction with the teaching environment at the College, and
my appreciation for the support and enthusiasm of the ICM Administrative team.
ICM has been a good experience for me.
I am very highly satisfied with the working conditions. All the ICM staff are very
enthusiastic and helpful towards the instructors.
Uniformly positive experience at ICM. Administration are supportive and does not
interfere in course delivery, as well as facilitative of extra-curricular initiatives (they do
not pursue profit at the expense of the program).
I’ve been extremely satisfied with the support of the ICM front office; they are indeed a
most competent group.
It’s been great working for ICM and I hope I can do more in the future. It’s a very relaxed
and professional atmosphere.

Note that email responses were quite brief, ranging from a single sentence to a maximum of 4 paragraphs.

This has been a great experience teaching such a diverse class.
ICM has been providing us all sorts of support, which is highly appreciable, and required
for a good educational environment.
I have been an instructor with ICM for the past **** years and have been very satisfied
with the experience. I greatly enjoy working with both the students and the staff at the
College. There is a high level of communication between myself and the ICM staff which
significantly adds to the level of support provided to students. I have always felt most
supported by ICM staff that have always considered and responded to my requests for
assistance in an effective and expedient manner.
I must say that the experience so far has been very positive. I have absolutely no
concerns regarding the work environment. The director and support staff are very
accommodating and helpful.
I had an excellent experience with ICM. They were very professional in their approach to
education, very interested in the welfare of international students, and quite keen on
upholding academic standards.
I especially found the feedback meetings at the start of each semester very useful.
Instructors had the opportunity to share their experiences in teaching international
students. We traded teaching strategies and discussed ways to address the challenges
that the students faced living and learning in a culture that they were not used to.
ICM staff are very helpful. I found the organization as a whole quite well organized.”
The working conditions at ICM are top-notch. I receive ample support from ICM
administration, student advisors, IT tech (more than I have ever received from personnel
at the U of M in general).
I don’t have anything to complain about in terms of working conditions at ICM. The staff
has been wonderful in terms of teaching and administrative supports and has made my
job easier.
That’s it. It’s been great working for ICM and I hope I can do more in the future. It’s a
very relaxed and professional atmosphere.”

One respondent expressed several concerns about their experience as an instructor at ICM, and
reportedly made the decision to discontinue working for the College. In particular this individual noted:
•

that the workload at ICM was substantially greater in terms of contact hours with students; this
being a major factor in the decision not to continue at the College.

•

the perception of accountability concerns, in that instructors were regularly "checked on" to see
how their classes were running, what students were doing, and if, in fact, the classes were
running for the full 4 hour prescribed time slot.

This individual stated their belief that the 4 hour sessions used at the College were inappropriate,
especially for international students for whom English is not the primary language. They also noted that
there was limited funding for teaching materials, and that they regularly purchased items from my own
funds, and expressed the view that no established process for seniority or selection of instructors was
evident

534

The comments above contrasted to those provided by the balance (16) of respondents who,
notwithstanding some issues of concern (see below), expressed a more positive view on the quality of
the ICM program—see following excerpts.

From my experience, I would credit the ICM with mentoring young and inexperienced
international students adapting to North American academic environment.
While the workload at the College may be slightly higher than that at the University, we are, to
some degree, compensated for that.
Despite being a corporate entity, students seem to be more valued than at the University. The
program is not just a money grab. It provides an intensive experience for the students, a lot of
work; but also provides attention to student support and follow-up. Weaker students are
followed up by the system and provided with counseling support. There is a real intent that
students succeed; from my perspective this is appreciated.
Administration is supportive and does not interfere in course delivery, as well as facilitative of
extra-curricular initiatives (they do not pursue profit at the expense of the program).
I like the 4 hour lectures for my subject; it gives me time to encourage the students to work on
problems while I walk around the class helping them. And sometimes I let the class go early (or
part of the class go early – those who get it) – and in the past (but not recently) I have been
discouraged from doing this.
My students often raise an issue that the ICM classes are too long and they get tired after 2
hours of a class. I personally feel that four hours per week is required to meet the curriculum
demands. The students feel that it would be more beneficial to them if there were two, two-hour
classes each week. I personally prefer a four hour class as it saves me time, but as an instructor I
would like to see my students getting the best out of it all. I thought as I am given a chance, I
should convey to you what students feel.”
There is a high level of communication between myself and the ICM staff which significantly adds
to the level of support provided to students. I have always felt most supported by ICM staff that
have always considered and responded to my requests for assistance in an effective and
expedient manner.
I especially found the feedback meetings at the start of each semester very useful. Instructors
had the opportunity to share their experiences in teaching international students. We traded
teaching strategies and discussed ways to address the challenges that the students faced living
and learning in a culture that they were not used to.”
I must emphasize, that I love teaching for ICM, for the longer class lecture sessions give me more
time to work with students who would normally be swamped by their classes (at the U of M),
and in my experience with other international students in my UM classes, be ill prepared to
succeed in their programs. ICM provides them the care, instruction, and guidance to integrate
and adapt to the U of M’s academic and cultural environments.

Of those respondents expressing general satisfaction with the working conditions at ICM, four noted
problems with some of the teaching rooms, suggesting “that not all (teaching) rooms are totally
acceptable”, and that temperature control of some of the rooms was poor. One response was
dominated by concerns about the quality of teaching space, noting that “the control of the temperature
is this room is horrible. Air conditioning was added during the summer of 2011 but it does not work very
well. At anything but the lowest setting it is too noisy to use, but at the lowest setting it can't keep the
room cool. There are two windows that open but one of them does not have a latch to keep it closed,

535

which is a problem in the winter. The whiteboards are seldom cleaned. For most of my lectures the
whiteboards are filthy.” Notwithstanding, this respondent did conclude that “this all being said, I did
very much enjoy the students and staff at ICM.”
One individual reported being “shuffled” around campus to different locations; two noted parking was
sometimes problematic, and one other respondent also expressed concerns about the lack of benefits,
health care and group life insurance, and benefits.
A number of respondents commented on the challenges and opportunities inherent in teaching
international students, but on balance felt that the experience was beneficial. Other than the above
concern about accountability the general view expressed was that the ICM program was strongly
supportive of both students and instructors.
One respondent commented that the greatest challenge to teaching at ICM arises due to unrealistic
student expectations, noting that many make the assumption that they will excel in class; many are
driven by their need gain entry into various UM faculties. It was further noted that a few students
attend ICM with the erroneous assumption that their programs will be easy, and that their work load
would be minimal. This particular respondent, who also reported holding an appointment at the
University of Manitoba, noted that the problem of unrealistic expectations was common to most first
year university students, but especially pronounced at ICM. This individual also reported that some
faculty members at the U of M may be under the false impression that ICM guarantees the academic
success their student’s. The respondent noted that there had been general discussion amongst ICM
instructors about student expectations and the genial view was that the instructors work very hard to
prepare ICM students for the U of M academic environment, and in no way, give students a ‘free or easy
ride’ through ICM classes.
The clear majority of respondents reported a positive interaction with the ICM program.

Appendix 14: Course Moderation Process and Course Compliance Form
International College of Manitoba and University of Manitoba Course
Overview of Role
Departments and Schools at the UM have an important role in providing oversight and being
a liaison with ICM to ensure the academic equivalency of ICM courses and ensure that the
course assessments are appropriate across ICM’s University Transfer Programs (UTP) Stage
II.
The Dean of the Faculty or Chair of Department/School will identify the Course Coordinators
(CC). The CC will be responsible for moderating ICM course assessments using the following
process.
UM academic units whose courses are taught by ICM will appoint a UM Course Coordinator
at least 4 weeks prior to the commencement of the semester. It is the responsibility of the
Course Coordinator to maintain regular contact with the ICM course instructor to provide
advice and discuss issues relating to the content and delivery of the course. The Course
Coordinator meets approximately once a semester with the Academic Manager to discuss
any outstanding issues in relation thereof. The Moderation process ensures that justice is
done to the individual student and upholds the standard of the Program within its
regulations.
The Course Coordinator is responsible (on behalf of the University) for:
(1) Ensuring ICM instructional staff have qualifications comparable to UM instructional staff.






Normally, UM will not have a role in interviews or hiring committees for ICM
instructors. However, the CC will be consulted to ensure that potential instructors
have qualifications appropriate for appointment and are suitable for providing
instruction.
Review and provide feedback on candidates based on CV information.
Whenever possible, recommend candidates to ICM or assist in the distribution of
information about ICM (i.e., via email groups and contacts).
ICM will seek approval from the UM before appointing UTP 11 instructors.

(2) Providing the instructor and or ICM with the current course outline and syllabus for the
equivalent university course. This includes details of the proposed assessment structure and
required course text(s).



Review and approve final ICM outline and syllabus prior to the course offering.
Review and approve final ICM assessment/grading scheme prior to the course
offering.

(3) Moderation of assignments, tests, and examinations to ensure equivalency of UM
assessment standards.



Review samples of in-course assignments and tests; advise on the adjustment of
grades if necessary; advise on the overall distribution of grades.
Review final exam and answer key prior to scheduling of exam-- questions and
acceptable answers must be approved by the Course Coordinator to ensure
equivalency to UM standards; that the exam can be completed within the allocated
time; that the questions are fair and free of ambiguity and error; and that the
solutions are sufficiently explicit to provide effective guidance to markers.

539






Review and approve deferred examinations with solutions as required.
Review samples of final examination; Course Coordinator can adjust grades as
necessary, and advise on the overall distribution of grades, but always in the context
of fairness to each student.
Approve course grades and supporting information as submitted by the ICM
instructor; when required, arrange for remarking of examinations or assignments,
similar to the role the UM department Chair (has) in vetting course grades.

(4) Return of all student results to the College within agreed timelines. The UM Course
Coordinator will liaise with the Academic Manager (or nominee) of the College with respect
to the release of final results.
(5) Advise ICM instructional and administrative staff on other issues as needed.
Overall, the role of the Course Coordinator is to advise and consult in order to
ensure that ICM students are evaluated in a manner that reflects the level and
rigour, consistent with the standards in equivalent UM courses.
In circumstances where a discrepancy arises, the parties will make every effort to reach a
resolution at the earliest point possible, before the course begins or before grades are
assigned.
Unresolved disputes will be directed to the Academic Advisory Committee for review and
resolution. In such circumstances, the student(s) involved (if any) will be informed in
writing that a decision has been deferred pending a resolution by the Academic Advisory
Committee. ICM reserves the right to request a written report of the dispute from the
Course Coordinator.
The College Instructor is responsible for
(1) Ensuring the course is taught and assessed in a manner consistent with the content and
spirit of the course outline, including adherence to the recommended program of instruction
and prescribed assessment framework, including the stated Learning Outcomes.
(2) Co-operating with the University Course Coordinator on matters such as tests,
assignments, projects, etc, to ensure high levels of comparability between the University
and College courses.
(3) Marking all assessment tasks in accordance with University guidelines and cooperating
with the Course Coordinator with respect to moderation of these assessment tasks; judging
students without prior influence and comparing their performance with that of their peers
(UM cohort), only recommending changes to the marks awarded to students within the
context of fairness to students.
(4) Setting a Final examination (and a deferred examination if required), providing the
solutions and agreeing to both paper(s) and solutions with the Course Coordinator.
(5) Forwarding final marks sheets in the required format to the Academic Administrator so
that final grades can be determined in a timely manner.
(6) Reporting to the Academic Manager on any matters of serious concern.
Moderation via University of Manitoba
The Course Coordinator will have overall responsibility for monitoring the academic
credibility of the course using the documentation provided by ICM-- that is, ensuring and
confirming that the questions set out in an assessment are comprehensive and of the

540

appropriate academic standard; and that the scripts are graded impartially and with the
rigour required for comparability to UM standards.
Student results are coordinated by the ICM Academic Manager, and released to students
through the ICM Student Portal.
The ICM College Director and Principal has final determination of all ICM graduates, and
thus potential progression to the appropriate University degree program.

Appendix 15: ICM Fees Disbursement, UM
April 4, 2015
In general, UM royalties received by the University of Manitoba are calculated 25% of ICM revenues
received for the delivery of the UTP I and UTP II programs. In addition, ICM levies a $94 Student
Ancillary Fee (combined Technology, Student Services, and Library Fees) that is transferred directly to
UM.
Other payments are made by ICM to the English Language Centre and Extended Education for supports
provided by sessional instructors and other services. As well, consumables, laboratory instructors, TAs
and graders associated with laboratory courses in UTP II are paid for by ICM. These payments are
negotiated by, and paid directly to the units delivering the respective courses, by ICM, and are not
included in the following.
Current reimbursement for teaching and supporting the ICM program is as follows.
a. Faculties receive $7,000 for each 3 credit, and $10,000 for each 6 credit hour course offered in
ICM, per 12 month period. This money goes directly to a Faculty, not a Department.
b. An additional $500 for every course section offered per 12 month period.
c. $2,500 for each laboratory course in any term (introduced 2009) to cover take down and set up
and any other support offered in the laboratory outside of actual laboratory instruction, or
grading.
d. The Library receives $5,000 (established 2008/09), however, they were required to demonstrate
actual costs prior to receiving further allocations—it is not clear that this requirement has been
addressed.
e. St. Paul’s College receives $7,800 (x3) each term ($23,400 p.a.) for use of two classrooms.
f. At the request of Student Affairs, an annual allocation of $40,000 for support to ICM students
was introduced in 2014/15.
Effective 2014/15, the following changes are proposed:
a. Faculties to receive $10,500 for each 3 credit hour course, per year. Six credit hour courses will
receive $10,500, per semester (i.e., the 6 credit course will be treated as two independent 3
credit courses), per year.
b. An additional $2,000 for every course section offered, for 3 credit hour courses, and $2,000 for
every 6 credit hour course section offered, per year.
c. Faculties currently receive $4,500 for each laboratory course, per year, to cover set up and any
other support offered in the laboratory outside of actual instruction, or grading costs.
d. Library to receive $6,000 annually, to assist with the costs of providing library services to ICM
students.
e. St. Paul’s College to receive $7,800 (x3) each term for use of two classrooms. Annual amount of
$23,400.
f. Student Affairs to receive $50,000 for support to ICM students.
g. Reimbursement for teaching and support for the ICM program will be reviewed biennially.

FIRST SCHEDULE
Rules for the ICM Programs
1.

ICM Programs shall be structured into units designed to facilitate student progression
to one or more University Programs.

2.

The names of the ICM Programs shall be determined by the College after consultation
with the University and be as approved by the University. At the time of the signing
of this Agreement the names of the ICM Programs are:
(a) University Transfer Program or UTP Stage II (UTP Stage II) for University
approved undergraduate ICM Programs; and
(b) University Transfer Program or UTP Stage I (UTP Stage I) for the pre-university
(Grade 12 equivalent) ICM Programs.

3.

The UTP Stage II shall generally comprise Courses of study (30 credit hours) from a
schedule of courses provided by the University, and may include required and elective
courses. These Courses may be changed from time to time, with the approval of the
University, to better prepare Students for the transition to the University Programs.

4.

The rules for the operation of the ICM Programs and Courses shall be consistent with
those of the University with respect to prerequisites, co-requisites, progression,
preclusions and exemptions. The College shall maintain a liaison with the relevant
University staff in order to monitor changes to the University’s practices. Whenever
possible, the University shall endeavour to advise the College of actual or impending
changes to its academic rules that might have an impact on the operation of the ICM
Programs or units comprised within them at least 12 months prior to those changes
taking effect.

5.

Eligibility for admission to the University shall be granted to all applicants who have
successfully completed the UTP Stage II with a minimum 30 credit hours and a
minimum comprehensive Grade Point Average (“GPA”) of 2.0, with Transfer Credit
into appropriate University Programs provided that Students meet any specified prerequisites and admission eligibility requirements as specified by the University in the
applicable Letter of Offer. Students who have successfully completed the UTP Stage
II may be admitted to University Programs, including competitive entry programs, on
the same basis as students who have completed equivalent subjects with the
University or other post-secondary institutions. In cases where the number of eligible
applicants exceeds the available spaces, applicants will require higher averages than
stipulated to be successful in the admissions competition.

6.

Students who are ineligible for admission to their desired University Program after
completing 30 credit hours of UTP Stage II Courses may be permitted to continue
their studies at the College to a maximum of 60 credit hours.

574

SECOND SCHEDULE
Admission Criteria

The College shall be solely responsible for the recruitment of students to the ICM
Programs and, as specified in this Schedule, shall ensure that students admitted satisfy
the admission criteria specified in this Schedule, or as agreed from time to time. The
College shall use reasonable endeavours to manage its recruitment of students to the
ICM Programs so that the number of Students in those programs at any one time does
not exceed the approximate maximum student level determined by the Provost &
Vice-President (Academic) upon recommendation from the Academic Advisory
Committee on an annual basis (which initially shall be approximately 1,300 Students
in the ICM Programs at any one time). It is acknowledged that it is not possible to
absolutely control the number of Students in the ICM Programs at any one time due to
variables outside the control of the College such as variable offer acceptance rates,
students applying to take breaks or defer their studies or needing to repeat courses.

2.

The Parties acknowledge that any agreed changes to the admission criteria for ICM
Programs will take effect no earlier than 12 months after such changes are agreed in
order to provide sufficient notice to the Parties for the updating of marketing
information. The University also acknowledges and agrees that, for the ICM Programs
to be successful, there must be a difference between the admission criteria for the UTP
Stage II ICM Programs and the admission criteria for direct entry into the first year of
Bachelor’s Degree University Programs. The University shall normally give the
College at least 12 months’ notice prior to any change to its admission criteria for its
equivalent University Programs taking effect. Notwithstanding this clause 2, earlier
changes may be made to admission criteria where required as a result of changes to
applicable laws or regulations.

3.

Students shall be admitted by the College to:
(a) the UTP Stage II ICM Programs only where students have completed study at the
secondary level equivalent to Grade 12 with an acceptable University entrance
average or an equivalent Canadian or international level, or have successfully
completed the UTP Stage I ICM Program; and
(b) the UTP Stage I ICM Programs only where students require additional academic
preparation prior to entering the UTP Stage II.

4.

All Students admitted to the UTP Stage II shall, where the University specifies a
Mathematics prerequisite:
(a)

display mathematics competency as evidenced by a grade of at least 60% in
mathematics at Grade 12 level or its equivalent; or

(b)

a minimum level of IELTS 5.5 for international students or the TOEFL
iBT, Pearson Versant Navitas English Test, EIKEN Japan, GCE ‘O’
Levels or HKDSE level specified in the table below;

or
(b)

have completed GCE “O” levels, or a year of study in high school for which
the instruction was in English or an undergraduate degree for which the
instruction was in English;

or
(c)

6.

if the student achieves a minimum level of IELTS 5.0 or equivalent, be
enrolled in a UTP with Academic English Study (“AES”) delivered by the
College.

For clarity, the below table sets out the English competency entry criteria for the UTP
and direct entry to a Bachelor’s Degree at the University (which, in relation to the
Bachelor’s Degree requirements is subject to any changes as determined by the

Damage or Destruction of the Facilities.
a)

If the Facilities are at any time destroyed or damaged (including, without
limitation, smoke and water damage) as a result of fire, the elements, accident
or other casualty required to be insured against by the University and not
caused by the College, and if as a result of such occurrence the Facilities are

Sixth Schedule, commence diligently to reconstruct, rebuild or repair the
Facilities;

b)

Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 5.1(a) of this Sixth Schedule, if

opinion of the University acting reasonably, the Facilities cannot be rebuilt or
made fit for the purposes of the College within one hundred eighty (180) days
of the happening of the damage or destruction, the University, instead of
rebuilding or making the Facilities fit for the College in accordance with
Section 5.1(a) of this Sixth Schedule may, at its option, elect to relocate the
College to alternative space with reasonably similar or better space, function
and quality to the Facilities;

586

c)

Nothing in this Section 5.1 requires the University to rebuild the Facilities in
the condition and state that existed before any such occurrence provided that
the Facilities, as re-built, will have reasonably similar or better space, facilities
services and quality to those in the Facilities prior to the damage or destruction
having regard, however, to the age of the Facilities at such time.
